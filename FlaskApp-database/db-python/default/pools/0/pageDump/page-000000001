[explanation by François Pinard]

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
representation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', not a[k]:

                                   0

                  1                                 2

          3               4                5               6

      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30


In the tree above, each cell `k' is topping `2*k+1' and `2*k+2'.  In
a usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree
to see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications
of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.
To be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to
replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes
that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,
but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.

If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly
the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the
diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down
the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.
This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.
By iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.

A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new
items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are
not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
incoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
time.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are
scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I
used for my MIDI sequencer :-).

Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively
studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,
the speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different
than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.

Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all
know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
sequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
followed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often
very cleverly organised[1].  It is very important that the initial
sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,
and much better for input fuzzily ordered.

Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which
may not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the
heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
for progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely
vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite
effective!

In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap' module
around. :-)

--------------------
[1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the
most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
"progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)
'u'Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged

Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!

mode and not ready; unlike their raw counterparts, they will never
return None.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer

BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO

The optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given
protocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default
protocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible
with previous versions.

Specifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol
version supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the
version of Python needed to read the pickle produced.

The *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single
bytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary
writing, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets
this interface.

If *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try
to map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python
2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

If *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are
serialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.

If *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number
of times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value
(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the
buffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.

It is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*
is None or smaller than 5.'clear_memodispatch_tablefastu'Pickler.memo'memou'Pickler.persistent_id'persistent_id_pickle.PicklerPickler_pickle.PicklingErroru'This takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.

The protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no
protocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's
representation are ignored.

The argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes
an integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no
arguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a
binary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any
other custom object that meets this interface.

Optional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,
which are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream
generated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to
map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The
*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string
instances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',
respectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit
string instances as bytes objects.'find_classu'Unpickler.memo'u'Unpickler.persistent_load'persistent_load_pickle.UnpicklerUnpickler_pickle.UnpicklingErrorUnpicklingErroru'Optimized C implementation for the Python pickle module.'Policy framework for the email package.

    This class is useless unless subclassed.  A subclass should define
    class attributes with defaults for any values that are to be
    managed by the Policy object.  The constructor will then allow
    non-default values to be set for these attributes at instance
    creation time.  The instance will be callable, taking these same
    attributes keyword arguments, and returning a new instance
    identical to the called instance except for those values changed
    by the keyword arguments.  Instances may be added, yielding new
    instances with any non-default values from the right hand
    operand overriding those in the left hand operand.  That is,

        A + B == A(<non-default values of B>)

    The repr of an instance can be used to reconstruct the object
    if and only if the repr of the values can be used to reconstruct
    those values.

        _append_docadded_doc_extend_docstringsControls for how messages are interpreted and formatted.

    Most of the classes and many of the methods in the email package accept
    Policy objects as parameters.  A Policy object contains a set of values and
    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.
    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC
    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'
    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.

    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing
    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,
    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by
    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can
    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default
    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the
    left operand.

    Settable attributes:

    raise_on_defect     -- If true, then defects should be raised as errors.
                           Default: False.

    linesep             -- string containing the value to use as separation
                           between output lines.  Default '\n'.

    cte_type            -- Type of allowed content transfer encodings

                           7bit  -- ASCII only
                           8bit  -- Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit is allowed

                           Default: 8bit.  Also controls the disposition of
                           (RFC invalid) binary data in headers; see the
                           documentation of the binary_fold method.

    max_line_length     -- maximum length of lines, excluding 'linesep',
                           during serialization.  None or 0 means no line
                           wrapping is done.  Default is 78.

                           serialized by a generator. Default: True.

    message_factory     -- the class to use to create new message objects.

            handle_defect(obj, defect)

        defect should be a Defect subclass, but in any case must be an
        Exception subclass.  obj is the object on which the defect should be
        registered if it is not raised.  If the raise_on_defect is True, the
        defect is raised as an error, otherwise the object and the defect are
        passed to register_defect.

        This method is intended to be called by parsers that discover defects.
        The email package parsers always call it with Defect instances.

        register_defectRecord 'defect' on 'obj'.

        Called by handle_defect if raise_on_defect is False.  This method is
        part of the Policy API so that Policy subclasses can implement custom
        defect handling.  The default implementation calls the append method of
        the defects attribute of obj.  The objects used by the email package by
        default that get passed to this method will always have a defects
        attribute with an append method.

        header_max_countReturn the maximum allowed number of headers named 'name'.

        Called when a header is added to a Message object.  If the returned
        value is not 0 or None, and there are already a number of headers with
        the name 'name' equal to the value returned, a ValueError is raised.

        Because the default behavior of Message's __setitem__ is to append the
        value to the list of headers, it is easy to create duplicate headers
        without realizing it.  This method allows certain headers to be limited
        in the number of instances of that header that may be added to a
        Message programmatically.  (The limit is not observed by the parser,
        which will faithfully produce as many headers as exist in the message
        being parsed.)

        The default implementation returns None for all header names.
        header_source_parsesourcelinesGiven a list of linesep terminated strings constituting the lines of
        a single header, return the (name, value) tuple that should be stored
        in the model.  The input lines should retain their terminating linesep
        characters.  The lines passed in by the email package may contain
        surrogateescaped binary data.

        'b'Controls for how messages are interpreted and formatted.

    Most of the classes and many of the methods in the email package accept
    Policy objects as parameters.  A Policy object contains a set of values and
    functions that control how input is interpreted and how output is rendered.
    For example, the parameter 'raise_on_defect' controls whether or not an RFC
    violation results in an error being raised or not, while 'max_line_length'
    controls the maximum length of output lines when a Message is serialized.

    Any valid attribute may be overridden when a Policy is created by passing
    it as a keyword argument to the constructor.  Policy objects are immutable,
    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by
    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can
    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default
    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the
    left operand.

This is an implementation of decimal floating point arithmetic based on
the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification:

    http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html

and IEEE standard 854-1987:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_854-1987

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

Here are some examples of using the decimal module:

    Used exceptions derive from this.
    If an exception derives from another exception besides this (such as
    Underflow (Inexact, Rounded, Subnormal) that indicates that it is only
    called if the others are present.  This isn't actually used for
    anything, though.

    handle  -- Called when context._raise_error is called and the
               trap_enabler is not set.  First argument is self, second is the
               context.  More arguments can be given, those being after
               the explanation in _raise_error (For example,
               context._raise_error(NewError, '(-x)!', self._sign) would
               call NewError().handle(context, self._sign).)

    To define a new exception, it should be sufficient to have it derive
    from DecimalException.
    Exponent of a 0 changed to fit bounds.

    This occurs and signals clamped if the exponent of a result has been
    altered in order to fit the constraints of a specific concrete
    representation.  This may occur when the exponent of a zero result would
    be outside the bounds of a representation, or when a large normal
    number would have an encoded exponent that cannot be represented.  In
    this latter case, the exponent is reduced to fit and the corresponding
    number of zero digits are appended to the coefficient ("fold-down").
    An invalid operation was performed.

    Various bad things cause this:

    Something creates a signaling NaN
    -INF + INF
    0 * (+-)INF
    (+-)INF / (+-)INF
    x % 0
    (+-)INF % x
    x._rescale( non-integer )
    sqrt(-x) , x > 0
    0 ** 0
    x ** (non-integer)
    x ** (+-)INF
    An operand is invalid

    The result of the operation after these is a quiet positive NaN,
    except when the cause is a signaling NaN, in which case the result is
    also a quiet NaN, but with the original sign, and an optional
    diagnostic information.
    _dec_from_triple_sign_intans_fix_nan_NaNTrying to convert badly formed string.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if a string is being
    converted to a number and it does not conform to the numeric string
    syntax.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Division by 0.

    This occurs and signals division-by-zero if division of a finite number
    by zero was attempted (during a divide-integer or divide operation, or a
    power operation with negative right-hand operand), and the dividend was
    not zero.

    The result of the operation is [sign,inf], where sign is the exclusive
    or of the signs of the operands for divide, or is 1 for an odd power of
    -0, for power.
    sign_SignedInfinityCannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when
    the values are required to be used.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    roundingEmaxNumerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.

    If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
    permitted in the Decimal() constructor, context.create_decimal() and
    all comparison operators. Both conversion and comparisons are exact.
    Any occurrence of a mixed operation is silently recorded by setting
    FloatOperation in the context flags.  Explicit conversions with
    Decimal.from_float() or context.create_decimal_from_float() do not
    set the flag.

    Otherwise (the signal is trapped), only equality comparisons and explicit
    conversions are silent. All other mixed operations raise FloatOperation.

        exactly representable in p digits.

        Assumes that elimination of special cases has already been
        performed: self and other must both be nonspecial; self must
        be positive and not numerically equal to 1; other must be
        nonzero.  For efficiency, other._exp should not be too large,
        so that 10**abs(other._exp) is a feasible calculation.xcxeycyezeroslast_digit_nbits9365emax_decimal_lshift_exactxc_bitsrem_log10_lbstr_xcReturn self ** other [ % modulo].

        With two arguments, compute self**other.

        With three arguments, compute (self**other) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - other must be nonnegative
         - either self or other (or both) must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and must have at most p digits,
           where p is the context precision.

        If any of these restrictions is violated the InvalidOperation
        flag is raised.

        The result of pow(self, other, modulo) is identical to the
        result that would be obtained by computing (self**other) %
        modulo with unbounded precision, but is computed more
        efficiently.  It is always exact.

        The result is the closest representable number to self
        (excluding self) that is in the direction towards other,
        unless both have the same value.  If the two operands are
        numerically equal, then the result is a copy of self with the

        >>> ExtendedContext.canonical(Decimal('2.50'))
        Decimal('2.50')
        canonical requires a Decimal as an argument.Compares values numerically.

        If the signs of the operands differ, a value representing each operand
        ('-1' if the operand is less than zero, '0' if the operand is zero or
        negative zero, or '1' if the operand is greater than zero) is used in
        place of that operand for the comparison instead of the actual
        operand.

        The comparison is then effected by subtracting the second operand from
        the first and then returning a value according to the result of the
        subtraction: '-1' if the result is less than zero, '0' if the result is
        zero or negative zero, or '1' if the result is greater than zero.

        Compares the values of the two operands numerically.

        It's pretty much like compare(), but all NaNs signal, with signaling

        Compares two operands using their abstract representation.

        This is not like the standard compare, which use their numerical

        Decimal('-1')
        >>> ExtendedContext.compare_total(1, Decimal(2))
        Decimal('-1')
        Compares two operands using their abstract representation ignoring sign.

        Like compare_total, but with operand's sign ignored and assumed to be 0.

        Copies the second operand's sign to the first one.

        In detail, it returns a copy of the first operand with the sign
        equal to the sign of the second operand.

        normalize reduces an operand to its simplest form.

        Essentially a plus operation with all trailing zeros removed from the
        result.

        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('2.1'))
        Decimal('2.1')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(Decimal('-2.0'))

        Decimal('0')
        >>> ExtendedContext.normalize(6)
        Decimal('6')
        Returns an indication of the class of the operand.

        The class is one of the following strings:

        plusPlus corresponds to unary prefix plus in Python.

        The operation is evaluated using the same rules as add; the
        operation plus(a) is calculated as add('0', a) where the '0'
        has the same exponent as the operand.

        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(Decimal('1.3'))
        Decimal('1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(Decimal('-1.3'))
        Decimal('-1.3')
        >>> ExtendedContext.plus(-1)
        Decimal('-1')
        powerRaises a to the power of b, to modulo if given.

        With two arguments, compute a**b.  If a is negative then b
        must be integral.  The result will be inexact unless b is
        integral and the result is finite and can be expressed exactly
        in 'precision' digits.

        With three arguments, compute (a**b) % modulo.  For the
        three argument form, the following restrictions on the
        arguments hold:

         - all three arguments must be integral
         - b must be nonnegative
         - at least one of a or b must be nonzero
         - modulo must be nonzero and have at most 'precision' digits

        The result of pow(a, b, modulo) is identical to the result
        that would be obtained by computing (a**b) % modulo with
        unbounded precision, but is computed more efficiently.  It is
        always exact.

        >>> ExtendedContext.power(7, Decimal(7), 2)
        Decimal('1')
        Returns a value equal to 'a' (rounded), having the exponent of 'b'.

        The coefficient of the result is derived from that of the left-hand
        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

        >>> ExtendedContext.quantize(Decimal('2.17'), Decimal('0.001'))
        Decimal('2.170')

        Just returns 10, as this is Decimal, :)

        >>> ExtendedContext.radix()
        Decimal('10')
        Returns the remainder from integer division.

        The result is the residue of the dividend after the operation of
        calculating integer division as described for divide-integer, rounded
        to precision digits if necessary.  The sign of the result, if
        non-zero, is the same as that of the original dividend.

        This operation will fail under the same conditions as integer division
        (that is, if integer division on the same two operands would fail, the
        remainder cannot be calculated).

        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder(Decimal('2.1'), Decimal('3'))
        Decimal('2.1')
        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder(Decimal('10'), Decimal('3'))

        Decimal('4')
        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder(22, Decimal(6))
        Decimal('4')
        Returns to be "a - b * n", where n is the integer nearest the exact
        value of "x / b" (if two integers are equally near then the even one
        is chosen).  If the result is equal to 0 then its sign will be the
        sign of a.

        This operation will fail under the same conditions as integer division
        (that is, if integer division on the same two operands would fail, the
        remainder cannot be calculated).

        >>> ExtendedContext.remainder_near(Decimal('2.1'), Decimal('3'))

        Decimal('3')
        Returns a rotated copy of a, b times.

        The coefficient of the result is a rotated copy of the digits in
        the coefficient of the first operand.  The number of places of
        rotation is taken from the absolute value of the second operand,
        with the rotation being to the left if the second operand is
        positive or to the right otherwise.

        Decimal('13333330')
        Returns True if the two operands have the same exponent.

        The result is never affected by either the sign or the coefficient of
        either operand.

        >>> ExtendedContext.scaleb(1, Decimal(4))
        Decimal('1E+4')
        Returns a shifted copy of a, b times.

        The coefficient of the result is a shifted copy of the digits
        in the coefficient of the first operand.  The number of places
        to shift is taken from the absolute value of the second operand,
        with the shift being to the left if the second operand is
        positive or to the right otherwise.  Digits shifted into the

        Convert to a string, using engineering notation if an exponent is needed.

        Engineering notation has an exponent which is a multiple of 3.  This
        can leave up to 3 digits to the left of the decimal place and may
        require the addition of either one or two trailing zeros.

        The operation is not affected by the context.

        to_sci_stringConverts a number to a string, using scientific notation.

        The operation is not affected by the context.
        Rounds to an integer.

        When the operand has a negative exponent, the result is the same
        as using the quantize() operation using the given operand as the
        left-hand-operand, 1E+0 as the right-hand-operand, and the precision
        of the operand as the precision setting; Inexact and Rounded flags
        are allowed in this operation.  The rounding mode is taken from the
        context.

        Rounds to an integer.

        When the operand has a negative exponent, the result is the same
        as using the quantize() operation using the given operand as the
        left-hand-operand, 1E+0 as the right-hand-operand, and the precision
        of the operand as the precision setting, except that no flags will
        be set.  The rounding mode is taken from the context.

    str_nval_n_sqrt_nearestClosest integer to the square root of the positive integer n.  a is
    an initial approximation to the square root.  Any positive integer
    will do for a, but the closer a is to the square root of n the
    faster convergence will be.

    Both arguments to _sqrt_nearest should be positive._rshift_nearestGiven an integer x and a nonnegative integer shift, return closest
    integer to x / 2**shift; use round-to-even in case of a tie.

    _div_nearestClosest integer to a/b, a and b positive integers; rounds to even
    in the case of a tie.

    _ilogMInteger approximation to M*log(x/M), with absolute error boundable
    in terms only of x/M.

    Given positive integers x and M, return an integer approximation to
    M * log(x/M).  For L = 8 and 0.1 <= x/M <= 10 the difference
    between the approximation and the exact result is at most 22.  For
    L = 8 and 1.0 <= x/M <= 10.0 the difference is at most 15.  In
    both cases these are upper bounds on the error; it will usually be
    much smaller.RyshiftGiven integers c, e and p with c > 0, p >= 0, compute an integer

    x/M <= 2.4, the absolute error in the result is bounded by 60 (and
    is usually much smaller).MshiftCompute an approximation to exp(c*10**e), with p decimal places of

    Returns integers d, f such that:

      10**(p-1) <= d <= 10**p, and
      (d-1)*10**f < exp(c*10**e) < (d+1)*10**f

    In other words, d*10**f is an approximation to exp(c*10**e) with p
    digits of precision, and with an error in d of at most 1.  This is
    almost, but not quite, the same as the error being < 1ulp: when d
    = 10**(p-1) the error could be up to 10 ulp.cshiftquotGiven integers xc, xe, yc and ye representing Decimals x = xc*10**xe and
    y = yc*10**ye, compute x**y.  Returns a pair of integers (c, e) such that:

      10**(p-1) <= c <= 10**p, and
      (c-1)*10**e < x**y < (c+1)*10**e

    in other words, c*10**e is an approximation to x**y with p digits
    of precision, and with an error in c of at most 1.  (This is
    almost, but not quite, the same as the error being < 1ulp: when c
    == 10**(p-1) we can only guarantee error < 10ulp.)

    We assume that: x is positive and not equal to 1, and y is nonzero.

    Turns a standard numeric format specifier into a dict, with the
    following entries:

      fill: fill character to pad field to minimum width
      align: alignment type, either '<', '>', '=' or '^'
      sign: either '+', '-' or ' '
      minimumwidth: nonnegative integer giving minimum width
      zeropad: boolean, indicating whether to pad with zeros
      thousands_sep: string to use as thousands separator, or ''
      grouping: grouping for thousands separators, in format
        used by localeconv
      decimal_point: string to use for decimal point
      precision: nonnegative integer giving precision, or None
      type: one of the characters 'eEfFgG%', or None

    unrecognised format for grouping_insert_thousands_sepmin_widthInsert thousands separators into a digit string.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

    fracpart: string of digits that must come after the point
    exp: exponent, as an integer
    spec: dictionary resulting from parsing the format specifier

    This function uses the information in spec to:
      insert separators (decimal separator and thousands separators)
      format the sign
      format the exponent

Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Cannot perform the division adequately.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if the integer result of a
    divide-integer or remainder operation had too many digits (would be
    longer than precision).  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'b'Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Undefined result of division.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if division by zero was
    attempted (during a divide-integer, divide, or remainder operation), and
    the dividend is also zero.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'b'Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is
    not exact (that is, it needed to be rounded and any discarded digits
    were non-zero), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    'u'Had to round, losing information.

    This occurs and signals inexact whenever the result of an operation is

    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The inexact signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) was inexact.
    'b'Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was
    detected during an operation.  This can occur if contexts are not checked
    on creation and either the precision exceeds the capability of the
    underlying concrete representation or an unknown or unsupported rounding
    was specified.  These aspects of the context need only be checked when
    the values are required to be used.  The result is [0,qNaN].
    'u'Invalid context.  Unknown rounding, for example.

    This occurs and signals invalid-operation if an invalid context was

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the
    coefficient), or if an overflow or underflow condition occurs.  The
    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    'u'Number got rounded (not  necessarily changed during rounding).

    This occurs and signals rounded whenever the result of an operation is
    rounded (that is, some zero or non-zero digits were discarded from the

    result in all cases is unchanged.

    The rounded signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    operation (or sequence of operations) caused a loss of precision.
    'b'Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    'u'Exponent < Emin before rounding.

    This occurs and signals subnormal whenever the result of a conversion or
    operation is subnormal (that is, its adjusted exponent is less than
    Emin, before any rounding).  The result in all cases is unchanged.

    The subnormal signal may be tested (or trapped) to determine if a given
    or operation (or sequence of operations) yielded a subnormal result.
    'b'Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    'u'Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide

    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.
    'b'Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    'u'Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.
    'b'Enable stricter semantics for mixing floats and Decimals.

    If the signal is not trapped (default), mixing floats and Decimals is
    permitted in the Decimal() constructor, context.create_decimal() and
    all comparison operators. Both conversion and comparisons are exact.
    Any occurrence of a mixed operation is silently recorded by setting
    FloatOperation in the context flags.  Explicit conversions with
    Decimal.from_float() or context.create_decimal_from_float() do not

        'b'Returns a value equal to 'a' (rounded), having the exponent of 'b'.

        The coefficient of the result is derived from that of the left-hand
        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

    the BoundMethodWeakref object keeps weak references to both the

        Basically this method of construction allows us to
        short-circuit creation of references to already-referenced
        instance methods.  The key corresponding to the target is
        calculated, and if there is already an existing reference,
        that is returned, with its deletion_methods attribute updated.
        Otherwise the new instance is created and registered in the
        table of already-referenced methods.

          reconstructable via the following, which is true of built-in
          instance methods::

            target.im_func.__get__( target.im_self )

        - ``on_delete``: Optional callback which will be called when
          this weak reference ceases to be valid (i.e. either the
          object or the function is garbage collected).  Should take a
          single argument, which will be passed a pointer to this

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.

'u'struct format string'u'Struct.format'iter_unpackpack_intou'struct size in bytes'u'Struct.size'unpackunpack_from_struct.StructStructu'Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

For example,# pythonw on Windows.# Iteration is defined in terms of a generator function,# returned by iter(self); use that to define next(). This works# because `self.iter` is an iterable consumed by that generator,# so it is re-entry safe. Calling `next(self.generator())`# twice works and does "what you want".# Only output the label as it changes if the output is not a# TTY. Use file=stderr if you expect to be piping stdout.# Update width in case the terminal has been resized# Render the line only if it changed.# self.avg is a rolling list of length <= 7 of steps where steps are# defined as time elapsed divided by the total progress through# self.length.# WARNING: the iterator interface for `ProgressBar` relies on# this and only works because this is a simple generator which# doesn't create or manage additional state. If this function# changes, the impact should be evaluated both against# `iter(bar)` and `next(bar)`. `next()` in particular may call# `self.generator()` repeatedly, and this must remain safe in# order for that interface to work.# This allows show_item_func to be updated before the# item is processed. Only trigger at the beginning of# the update interval.# If we're piping to less we might support colors under the# condition that# Less doesn't respect ^C, but catches it for its own UI purposes (aborting# search or other commands inside less).# That means when the user hits ^C, the parent process (click) terminates,# but less is still alive, paging the output and messing up the terminal.# If the user wants to make the pager exit on ^C, they should set# `LESS='-K'`. It's not our decision to make.# TODO: This never terminates if the passed generator never terminates.# If the filesystem resolution is 1 second, like Mac OS# 10.12 Extended, or 2 seconds, like FAT32, and the editor# closes very fast, require_save can fail. Set the modified# time to be 2 seconds in the past to work around this.# Depending on the resolution, the exact value might not be# recorded, so get the new recorded value.# Unix-like, Ctrl+D# Windows, Ctrl+Z# The function `getch` will return a bytes object corresponding to# the pressed character. Since Windows 10 build 1803, it will also# return \x00 when called a second time after pressing a regular key.# `getwch` does not share this probably-bugged behavior. Moreover, it# returns a Unicode object by default, which is what we want.# Either of these functions will return \x00 or \xe0 to indicate# a special key, and you need to call the same function again to get# the "rest" of the code. The fun part is that \u00e0 is# "latin small letter a with grave", so if you type that on a French# keyboard, you _also_ get a \xe0.# E.g., consider the Up arrow. This returns \xe0 and then \x48. The# resulting Unicode string reads as "a with grave" + "capital H".# This is indistinguishable from when the user actually types# "a with grave" and then "capital H".# When \xe0 is returned, we assume it's part of a special-key sequence# and call `getwch` again, but that means that when the user types# the \u00e0 character, `getchar` doesn't return until a second# character is typed.# The alternative is returning immediately, but that would mess up# cross-platform handling of arrow keys and others that start with# \xe0. Another option is using `getch`, but then we can't reliably# read non-ASCII characters, because return values of `getch` are# limited to the current 8-bit codepage.# Anyway, Click doesn't claim to do this Right(tm), and using `getwch`# is doing the right thing in more situations than with `getch`.# \x00 and \xe0 are control characters that indicate special key,# see above.b'

(Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local
 class.  Depending on the version of Python you're using, there may be a
 faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
 `threading`.)

Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
a thread-local object and use its attributes:

  >>> mydata = local()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.number
  42

You can also access the local-object's dictionary:

  >>> mydata.__dict__
  {'number': 42}
  >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
  []
  >>> mydata.widgets
  []

What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> def f():
  ...     items = sorted(mydata.__dict__.items())
  ...     log.append(items)
  ...     mydata.number = 11
  ...     log.append(mydata.number)

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[], 11]

we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
don't affect data seen in this thread:

  >>> mydata.number
  42

Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
came from.

You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     number = 2
  ...     def __init__(self, /, **kw):
  ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
  ...     def squared(self):
  ...         return self.number ** 2

This can be useful to support default values, methods and
initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.

Now if we create a local object:

  >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')

Now we have a default number:

  >>> mydata.number
  2

an initial color:

  >>> mydata.color
  'red'
  >>> del mydata.color

And a method that operates on the data:

  >>> mydata.squared()
  4

As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[('color', 'red')], 11]

without affecting this thread's data:

  >>> mydata.number
  2
  >>> mydata.color
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'

Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
local. They are shared across threads:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     __slots__ = 'number'

  >>> mydata = MyLocal()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.color = 'red'

So, the separate thread:

  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()

    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flask('yourapplication')
            app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplication.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

    .. versionadded:: 0.7
       The `static_url_path`, `static_folder`, and `template_folder`
       parameters were added.

    .. versionadded:: 0.8
       The `instance_path` and `instance_relative_config` parameters were
       added.

    .. versionadded:: 0.11
       The `root_path` parameter was added.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0
       The ``host_matching`` and ``static_host`` parameters were added.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0
       The ``subdomain_matching`` parameter was added. Subdomain
       matching needs to be enabled manually now. Setting
       :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicitly enable it.

    :param import_name: the name of the application package
    :param static_url_path: can be used to specify a different path for the
                            static files on the web.  Defaults to the name
                            of the `static_folder` folder.
    :param static_folder: The folder with static files that is served at
        ``static_url_path``. Relative to the application ``root_path``
        or an absolute path. Defaults to ``'static'``.
    :param static_host: the host to use when adding the static route.
        Defaults to None. Required when using ``host_matching=True``
        with a ``static_folder`` configured.
    :param host_matching: set ``url_map.host_matching`` attribute.
        Defaults to False.
    :param subdomain_matching: consider the subdomain relative to
        :data:`SERVER_NAME` when matching routes. Defaults to False.
    :param template_folder: the folder that contains the templates that should
                            be used by the application.  Defaults to
                            ``'templates'`` folder in the root path of the
                            application.
    :param instance_path: An alternative instance path for the application.
                          By default the folder ``'instance'`` next to the
                          package or module is assumed to be the instance
                          path.
    :param instance_relative_config: if set to ``True`` relative filenames
                                     for loading the config are assumed to
                                     be relative to the instance path instead
                                     of the application root.
    :param root_path: The path to the root of the application files.
        This should only be set manually when it can't be detected
        automatically, such as for namespace packages.

        .. versionadded:: 0.8
        A standard Python :class:`~logging.Logger` for the app, with
        the same name as :attr:`name`.

        In debug mode, the logger's :attr:`~logging.Logger.level` will
        be set to :data:`~logging.DEBUG`.

        If there are no handlers configured, a default handler will be
        added. See :doc:`/logging` for more information.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1.0
            The logger takes the same name as :attr:`name` rather than
            hard-coding ``"flask.app"``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0
            Behavior was simplified. The logger is always named
            ``"flask.app"``. The level is only set during configuration,
            it doesn't check ``app.debug`` each time. Only one format is
            used, not different ones depending on ``app.debug``. No
            handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no
            handlers are already configured.

        .. versionadded:: 0.3
        jinja_envThe Jinja environment used to load templates.

        The environment is created the first time this property is
        accessed. Changing :attr:`jinja_options` after that will have no
        effect.
        create_jinja_environmentgot_first_requestThis attribute is set to ``True`` if the application started
        handling the first request.

        .. versionadded:: 0.8
        'got_first_request' is deprecated and will be removed in Flask 2.4.instance_relativeUsed to create the config attribute by the Flask constructor.
        The `instance_relative` parameter is passed in from the constructor
        of Flask (there named `instance_relative_config`) and indicates if
        the config should be relative to the instance path or the root path
        of the application.

        .. versionadded:: 0.8
        Create the object to assign to :attr:`aborter`. That object
        is called by :func:`flask.abort` to raise HTTP errors, and can
        be called directly as well.

        By default, this creates an instance of :attr:`aborter_class`,
        which defaults to :class:`werkzeug.exceptions.Aborter`.

        .. versionadded:: 2.2
        Tries to locate the instance path if it was not provided to the

        (:attr:`instance_path`).  Otherwise works like
        :meth:`open_resource`.  Instance resources can also be opened for
        writing.

        :param resource: the name of the resource.  To access resources within
                         subfolders use forward slashes as separator.
        :param mode: resource file opening mode, default is 'rb'.
        Create the Jinja environment based on :attr:`jinja_options`
        and the various Jinja-related methods of the app. Changing
        :attr:`jinja_options` after this will have no effect. Also adds
        Flask-related globals and filters to the environment.

        override just the loader and keeping the rest unchanged.  It's
        discouraged to override this function.  Instead one should override
        the :meth:`jinja_loader` function instead.

        The global loader dispatches between the loaders of the application
        and the individual blueprints.

        .. versionadded:: 0.5
        .html.htm.xml.xhtml.svgupdate_template_contextUpdate the template context with some commonly used variables.
        This injects request, session, config and g into the template
        context as well as everything template context processors want
        to inject.  Note that the as of Flask 0.6, the original values
        in the context will not be overridden if a context processor
        decides to return a value with the same key.

        :param context: the context as a dictionary that is updated in place
                        to add extra variables.
        orig_ctxtemplate_context_processorsmake_shell_contextReturns the shell context for an interactive shell for this
        application.  This runs all the registered shell context
        processors.

        .. versionadded:: 0.11
        processorWhether debug mode is enabled. When using ``flask run`` to start the
        development server, an interactive debugger will be shown for unhandled
        exceptions, and the server will be reloaded when code changes. This maps to the
        :data:`DEBUG` config key. It may not behave as expected if set late.

        **Do not enable debug mode when deploying in production.**

        Default: ``False``
        portload_dotenvRuns the application on a local development server.

        Do not use ``run()`` in a production setting. It is not intended to
        meet security and performance requirements for a production server.
        Instead, see :doc:`/deploying/index` for WSGI server recommendations.

        If the :attr:`debug` flag is set the server will automatically reload
        for code changes and show a debugger in case an exception happened.

        If you want to run the application in debug mode, but disable the
        code execution on the interactive debugger, you can pass
        ``use_evalex=False`` as parameter.  This will keep the debugger's
        traceback screen active, but disable code execution.

        It is not recommended to use this function for development with
        automatic reloading as this is badly supported.  Instead you should
        be using the :command:`flask` command line script's ``run`` support.

        .. admonition:: Keep in Mind

           Flask will suppress any server error with a generic error page
           unless it is in debug mode.  As such to enable just the
           interactive debugger without the code reloading, you have to
           invoke :meth:`run` with ``debug=True`` and ``use_reloader=False``.
           Setting ``use_debugger`` to ``True`` without being in debug mode
           won't catch any exceptions because there won't be any to
           catch.

        :param host: the hostname to listen on. Set this to ``'0.0.0.0'`` to
            have the server available externally as well. Defaults to
            ``'127.0.0.1'`` or the host in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable
            if present.
        :param port: the port of the webserver. Defaults to ``5000`` or the
            port defined in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable if present.
        :param debug: if given, enable or disable debug mode. See
            :attr:`debug`.
        :param load_dotenv: Load the nearest :file:`.env` and :file:`.flaskenv`
            files to set environment variables. Will also change the working
            directory to the directory containing the first file found.
        :param options: the options to be forwarded to the underlying Werkzeug
            server. See :func:`werkzeug.serving.run_simple` for more
            information.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0
            If installed, python-dotenv will be used to load environment
            variables from :file:`.env` and :file:`.flaskenv` files.

            The :envvar:`FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable will override :attr:`debug`.

            Threaded mode is enabled by default.

For information
        about unit testing head over to :doc:`/testing`.

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your
        application code, you must set ``app.testing = True`` in order for the
        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if
        you want to access the context locals for testing::

            with app.test_client() as c:
                rv = c.get('/?vodka=42')
                assert request.args['vodka'] == '42'

        Additionally, you may pass optional keyword arguments that will then
        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    self._authentication = kwargs.pop("authentication")
                    super(CustomClient,self).__init__( *args, **kwargs)

            app.test_client_class = CustomClient
            client = app.test_client(authentication='Basic ....')

        See :class:`~flask.testing.FlaskClient` for more information.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.4
           added support for ``with`` block usage for the client.

        .. versionadded:: 0.7
           The `use_cookies` parameter was added as well as the ability
           to override the client to be used by setting the

        .. versionchanged:: 0.11

        blueprint.

        Calls the blueprint's :meth:`~flask.Blueprint.register` method after
        recording the blueprint in the application's :attr:`blueprints`.

        :param blueprint: The blueprint to register.
        :param url_prefix: Blueprint routes will be prefixed with this.
        :param subdomain: Blueprint routes will match on this subdomain.
        :param url_defaults: Blueprint routes will use these default values for
            view arguments.
        :param options: Additional keyword arguments are passed to
            :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState`. They can be
            accessed in :meth:`~flask.Blueprint.record` callbacks.

            The ``name`` option can be used to change the (pre-dotted)
            name the blueprint is registered with. This allows the same

        teardown_appcontextRegisters a function to be called when the application
        context is popped. The application context is typically popped
        after the request context for each request, at the end of CLI
        commands, or after a manually pushed context ends.

        .. code-block:: python

            with app.app_context():
                ...

        When the ``with`` block exits (or ``ctx.pop()`` is called), the
        teardown functions are called just before the app context is
        made inactive. Since a request context typically also manages an
        application context it would also be called when you pop a
        request context.

        When a teardown function was called because of an unhandled
        exception it will be passed an error object. If an
        :meth:`errorhandler` is registered, it will handle the exception
        and the teardown will not receive it.

        Teardown functions must avoid raising exceptions. If they
        execute code that might fail they must surround that code with a
        ``try``/``except`` block and log any errors.

        The return values of teardown functions are ignored.

        blueprint handler for an exception class, app handler for an exception
        class, or ``None`` if a suitable handler is not found.
        _get_exc_class_and_codeexc_classerror_handler_spechandler_maphandle_http_exceptionResponseReturnValueHandles an HTTP exception.  By default this will invoke the

            ``RoutingException``, used internally for actions such as

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0
            Exceptions are looked up by code *and* by MRO, so

        .. versionadded:: 0.3
        ensure_synctrap_http_exceptionChecks if an HTTP exception should be trapped or not.  By default
        this will return ``False`` for all exceptions except for a bad request
        key error if ``TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS`` is set to ``True``.  It
        also returns ``True`` if ``TRAP_HTTP_EXCEPTIONS`` is set to ``True``.

        This is called for all HTTP exceptions raised by a view function.
        If it returns ``True`` for any exception the error handler for this
        exception is not called and it shows up as regular exception in the
        traceback.  This is helpful for debugging implicitly raised HTTP
        exceptions.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0
            Bad request errors are not trapped by default in debug mode.

        .. versionadded:: 0.8
        trap_bad_requesthandle_user_exceptionThis method is called whenever an exception occurs that

        .exceptions.HTTPException` which is forwarded to the
        :meth:`handle_http_exception` method. This function will either
        return a response value or reraise the exception with the same
        traceback.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0
            Key errors raised from request data like ``form`` show the

        show_exceptionhandle_exceptionHandle an exception that did not have an error handler
        associated with it, or that was raised from an error handler.
        This always causes a 500 ``InternalServerError``.

        Always sends the :data:`got_request_exception` signal.

        If :data:`PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS` is ``True``, such as in debug
        mode, the error will be re-raised so that the debugger can
        display it. Otherwise, the original exception is logged, and
        an :exc:`~werkzeug.exceptions.InternalServerError` is returned.

        If an error handler is registered for ``InternalServerError`` or
        ``500``, it will be used. For consistency, the handler will
        always receive the ``InternalServerError``. The original
        unhandled exception is available as ``e.original_exception``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1.0
            Always passes the ``InternalServerError`` instance to the

        asgiref.syncasgiref_async_to_syncInstall Flask with the 'async' extra in order to use async views._anchor_method_scheme_externalGenerate a URL to the given endpoint with the given values.

        This is called by :func:`flask.url_for`, and can be called
        directly as well.

        An *endpoint* is the name of a URL rule, usually added with
        :meth:`@app.route() <route>`, and usually the same name as the
        view function. A route defined in a :class:`~flask.Blueprint`
        will prepend the blueprint's name separated by a ``.`` to the
        endpoint.

        In some cases, such as email messages, you want URLs to include
        the scheme and domain, like ``https://example.com/hello``. When
        not in an active request, URLs will be external by default, but
        this requires setting :data:`SERVER_NAME` so Flask knows what
        domain to use. :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` and
        :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` should also be configured as
        needed. This config is only used when not in an active request.

        Functions can be decorated with :meth:`url_defaults` to modify
        keyword arguments before the URL is built.

        If building fails for some reason, such as an unknown endpoint
        or incorrect values, the app's :meth:`handle_url_build_error`
        method is called. If that returns a string, that is returned,
        otherwise a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` is raised.

        :param endpoint: The endpoint name associated with the URL to
            generate. If this starts with a ``.``, the current blueprint
            name (if any) will be used.
        :param _anchor: If given, append this as ``#anchor`` to the URL.
        :param _method: If given, generate the URL associated with this
            method for the endpoint.
        :param _scheme: If given, the URL will have this scheme if it
            is external.
        :param _external: If given, prefer the URL to be internal
            (False) or require it to be external (True). External URLs
            include the scheme and domain. When not in an active
            request, URLs are external by default.
        :param values: Values to use for the variable parts of the URL
            rule. Unknown keys are appended as query string arguments,
            like ``?a=b&c=d``.

        Convert the return value from a view function to an instance of
        :attr:`response_class`.

        :param rv: the return value from the view function. The view function
            must return a response. Returning ``None``, or the view ending
            without returning, is not allowed. The following types are allowed
            for ``view_rv``:

            ``str``
                A response object is created with the string encoded to UTF-8
                as the body.

            ``bytes``
                A response object is created with the bytes as the body.

            ``dict``
                A dictionary that will be jsonify'd before being returned.

            ``list``
                A list that will be jsonify'd before being returned.

            ``generator`` or ``iterator``
                A generator that returns ``str`` or ``bytes`` to be
                streamed as the response.

            ``tuple``
                Either ``(body, status, headers)``, ``(body, status)``, or
                ``(body, headers)``, where ``body`` is any of the other types
                allowed here, ``status`` is a string or an integer, and
                ``headers`` is a dictionary or a list of ``(key, value)``
                tuples. If ``body`` is a :attr:`response_class` instance,
                ``status`` overwrites the exiting value and ``headers`` are
                extended.

            :attr:`response_class`
                The object is returned unchanged.

            other :class:`~werkzeug.wrappers.Response` class
                The object is coerced to :attr:`response_class`.

            :func:`callable`

        will be re-raised.

        Each function in :attr:`url_build_error_handlers` is called with
        ``error``, ``endpoint`` and ``values``. If a function returns
        ``None`` or raises a ``BuildError``, it is skipped. Otherwise,
        its return value is returned by ``url_for``.

        :param error: The active ``BuildError`` being handled.

        Called before the request is dispatched. Calls

        current blueprint (if any). Then calls :attr:`before_request_funcs`
        registered with the app and the blueprint.

        If any :meth:`before_request` handler returns a non-None value, the
        value is handled as if it was the return value from the view, and
        further request handling is stopped.

        This calls all functions decorated with

        if a blueprint handled the request. Finally, the

        after the request context. See :meth:`do_teardown_request`.

        This calls all functions decorated with
        :meth:`teardown_appcontext`. Then the
        :data:`appcontext_tearing_down` signal is sent.

        This is called by
        :meth:`AppContext.pop() <flask.ctx.AppContext.pop>`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9
        app_contextCreate an :class:`~flask.ctx.AppContext`. Use as a ``with``
        block to push the context, which will make :data:`current_app`
        point at this application.

        An application context is automatically pushed by
        :meth:`RequestContext.push() <flask.ctx.RequestContext.push>`
        when handling a request, and when running a CLI command. Use
        this to manually create a context outside of these situations.

        ::

            with app.app_context():
                init_db()

        See :doc:`/appcontext`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.9
        request_contextCreate a :class:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext` representing a
        WSGI environment. Use a ``with`` block to push the context,
        which will make :data:`request` point at this request.

        See :doc:`/reqcontext`.

        Typically you should not call this from your own code. A request
        context is automatically pushed by the :meth:`wsgi_app` when
        handling a request. Use :meth:`test_request_context` to create
        an environment and context instead of this method.

        :param environ: a WSGI environment
        test_request_contextCreate a :class:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext` for a WSGI
        environment created from the given values. This is mostly useful
        during testing, where you may want to run a function that uses
        request data without dispatching a full request.

        See :doc:`/reqcontext`.

        Use a ``with`` block to push the context, which will make
        :data:`request` point at the request for the created
        environment. ::

            with app.test_request_context(...):
                generate_report()

        When using the shell, it may be easier to push and pop the
        context manually to avoid indentation. ::

            ctx = app.test_request_context(...)
            ctx.push()
            ...
            ctx.pop()

        Takes the same arguments as Werkzeug's
        :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`, with some defaults from
        the application. See the linked Werkzeug docs for most of the
        available arguments. Flask-specific behavior is listed here.

        :param path: URL path being requested.
        :param base_url: Base URL where the app is being served, which
            ``path`` is relative to. If not given, built from
            :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`, ``subdomain``,
            :data:`SERVER_NAME`, and :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT`.
        :param subdomain: Subdomain name to append to
            :data:`SERVER_NAME`.
        :param url_scheme: Scheme to use instead of
            :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`.
        :param data: The request body, either as a string or a dict of
            form keys and values.
        :param json: If given, this is serialized as JSON and passed as
            ``data``. Also defaults ``content_type`` to
            ``application/json``.
        :param args: other positional arguments passed to
            :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`.
        :param kwargs: other keyword arguments passed to
            :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder`.
        EnvironBuilderbuilderget_environwsgi_appThe actual WSGI application. This is not implemented in
        :meth:`__call__` so that middlewares can be applied without
        losing a reference to the app object. Instead of doing this::

            app = MyMiddleware(app)

        It's a better idea to do this instead::

            app.wsgi_app = MyMiddleware(app.wsgi_app)

        Then you still have the original application object around and
        can continue to call methods on it.

            Teardown events for the request and app contexts are called
            even if an unhandled error occurs. Other events may not be
            called depending on when an error occurs during dispatch.

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flask('yourapplication')
            app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplication.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your
        application code, you must set ``app.testing = True`` in order for the
        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if
        you want to access the context locals for testing::

            with app.test_client() as c:
                rv = c.get('/?vodka=42')
                assert request.args['vodka'] == '42'

        Additionally, you may pass optional keyword arguments that will then
        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):

        'u'Creates a test client for this application.  For information
        about unit testing head over to :doc:`/testing`.

        Note that if you are testing for assertions or exceptions in your
        application code, you must set ``app.testing = True`` in order for the
        exceptions to propagate to the test client.  Otherwise, the exception
        will be handled by the application (not visible to the test client) and
        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a
        500 status code response to the test client.  See the :attr:`testing`
        attribute.  For example::

            app.testing = True
            client = app.test_client()

        The test client can be used in a ``with`` block to defer the closing down
        of the context until the end of the ``with`` block.  This is useful if
        you want to access the context locals for testing::

            with app.test_client() as c:
                rv = c.get('/?vodka=42')
                assert request.args['vodka'] == '42'

        Additionally, you may pass optional keyword arguments that will then
        be passed to the application's :attr:`test_client_class` constructor.
        For example::

            from flask.testing import FlaskClient

            class CustomClient(FlaskClient):
                def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    self._authentication = kwargs.pop("authentication")
                    super(CustomClient,self).__init__( *args, **kwargs)

            app.test_client_class = CustomClient
            client = app.test_client(authentication='Basic ....')

        See :class:`~flask.testing.FlaskClient` for more information.

        An *endpoint* is the name of a URL rule, usually added with

        view function. A route defined in a :class:`~flask.Blueprint`
        will prepend the blueprint's name separated by a ``.`` to the
        endpoint.

        In some cases, such as email messages, you want URLs to include
        the scheme and domain, like ``https://example.com/hello``. When
        not in an active request, URLs will be external by default, but
        this requires setting :data:`SERVER_NAME` so Flask knows what
        domain to use. :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` and
        :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` should also be configured as
        needed. This config is only used when not in an active request.

        Functions can be decorated with :meth:`url_defaults` to modify
        keyword arguments before the URL is built.

        'u'flask.app'Command-line parsing library

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

            same values as the builtin open() function.

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

Methods:

append() -- append a new item to the end of the array
buffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info
byteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array
count() -- return number of occurrences of an object
extend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable
fromfile() -- read items from a file object
fromlist() -- append items from the list
frombytes() -- append items from the string
index() -- return index of first occurrence of an object
insert() -- insert a new item into the array at a provided position
pop() -- remove and return item (default last)
remove() -- remove first occurrence of an object
reverse() -- reverse the order of the items in the array
tofile() -- write all items to a file object
tolist() -- return the array converted to an ordinary list
tobytes() -- return the array converted to a string

    ast
    ~~~

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

nullcontexttype_commentsfeature_version
    Parse the source into an AST node.
    Equivalent to compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST).
    Pass type_comments=True to get back type comments where the syntax allows.
    _feature_versionliteral_evalnode_or_string
    Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python
    expression.  The string or node provided may only consist of the following
    Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts,
    sets, booleans, and None.
    _raise_malformed_nodemalformed node or string: _convert_num_convert_signed_numoperand_converteltsleftrightannotate_fieldsinclude_attributes
    Return a formatted dump of the tree in node.  This is mainly useful for
    debugging purposes.  If annotate_fields is true (by default),
    the returned string will show the names and the values for fields.
    If annotate_fields is false, the result string will be more compact by
    omitting unambiguous field names.  Attributes such as line
    numbers and column offsets are not dumped by default.  If this is wanted,
    include_attributes can be set to true.  If indent is a non-negative
    integer or string, then the tree will be pretty-printed with that indent
    level. None (the default) selects the single line representation.
    ,
allsimplesimple%s=%s%s(%s%s)[%s%s]expected AST, got %rcopy_locationnew_nodeold_node
    Copy source location (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, and `end_col_offset`
    attributes) from *old_node* to *new_node* if possible, and return *new_node*.
    col_offsetend_fix_missing_locations
    When you compile a node tree with compile(), the compiler expects lineno and
    col_offset attributes for every node that supports them.  This is rather
    tedious to fill in for generated nodes, so this helper adds these attributes
    recursively where not already set, by setting them to the values of the
    parent node.  It works recursively starting at *node*.
    iter_child_nodesincrement_lineno
    Increment the line number and end line number of each node in the tree
    starting at *node* by *n*. This is useful to "move code" to a different
    location in a file.
    iter_fields
    Yield a tuple of ``(fieldname, value)`` for each field in ``node._fields``
    that is present on *node*.
    
    Yield all direct child nodes of *node*, that is, all fields that are nodes
    and all items of fields that are lists of nodes.
    get_docstringclean
    Return the docstring for the given node or None if no docstring can
    be found.  If the node provided does not have docstrings a TypeError
    will be raised.

    If *clean* is `True`, all tabs are expanded to spaces and any whitespace
    that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed.
    %r can't have docstringsStrcleandoc_splitlines_no_ffSplit a string into lines ignoring form feed and other chars.

    This mimics how the Python parser splits source code.
    next_line_pad_whitespaceReplace all chars except '\f\t' in a line with spaces.	get_source_segmentpaddedGet source code segment of the *source* that generated *node*.

    If some location information (`lineno`, `end_lineno`, `col_offset`,
    or `end_col_offset`) is missing, return None.

    If *padded* is `True`, the first line of a multi-line statement will
    be padded with spaces to match its original position.
    
    Recursively yield all descendant nodes in the tree starting at *node*
    (including *node* itself), in no specified order.  This is useful if you
    only want to modify nodes in place and don't care about the context.
    todoNodeVisitor
    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.
    visitVisit a node.visit_generic_visitvisitorCalled if no explicit visitor function exists for a node.visit_Constant_const_node_type_names is deprecated; add visit_ConstantNodeTransformer
    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups
    (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),
                   slice=Constant(value=node.id),
                   ctx=node.ctx
               )

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.

    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups
    (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),
                   slice=Constant(value=node.id),
                   ctx=node.ctx
               )

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)

A small implementation of signals, inspired by a snippet of Django signal
API client code seen in a blog post.  Signals are first-class objects and
each manages its own receivers and message emission.

The :func:`signal` function provides singleton behavior for named signals.

blinker._utilitiesT_callableAsyncWrapperTypeSyncWrapperTypeToken for "any sender".ANY_IDA notification emitter.Emitted after each :meth:`connect`.

        The signal sender is the signal instance, and the :meth:`connect`
        arguments are passed through: *receiver*, *sender*, and *weak*.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

        Emitted after a receiver connects.receiver_disconnectedEmitted after :meth:`disconnect`.

        The sender is the signal instance, and the :meth:`disconnect` arguments
        are passed through: *receiver* and *sender*.

        Note, this signal is emitted **only** when :meth:`disconnect` is
        called explicitly.

        The disconnect signal can not be emitted by an automatic disconnect
        (due to a weakly referenced receiver or sender going out of scope),
        as the receiver and/or sender instances are no longer available for
        use at the time this signal would be emitted.

        An alternative approach is available by subscribing to
        :attr:`receiver_connected` and setting up a custom weakref cleanup
        callback on weak receivers and senders.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

        Emitted after a receiver disconnects.
        :param doc: optional.  If provided, will be assigned to the signal's
          __doc__ attribute.

        receiversis_muted_by_receiver_by_sender_weak_sendersconnectreceiversenderConnect *receiver* to signal events sent by *sender*.

        :param receiver: A callable.  Will be invoked by :meth:`send` with
          `sender=` as a single positional argument and any ``kwargs`` that
          were provided to a call to :meth:`send`.

        :param sender: Any object or :obj:`ANY`, defaults to ``ANY``.
          Restricts notifications delivered to *receiver* to only those
          :meth:`send` emissions sent by *sender*.  If ``ANY``, the receiver
          will always be notified.  A *receiver* may be connected to
          multiple *sender* values on the same Signal through multiple calls
          to :meth:`connect`.

        :param weak: If true, the Signal will hold a weakref to *receiver*
          and automatically disconnect when *receiver* goes out of scope or
          is garbage collected.  Defaults to True.

        receiver_ref_cleanup_receiver_cleanup_sendersender_refdisconnectreceiver_argsender_argweak_argconnect_viaConnect the decorated function as a receiver for *sender*.

        :param sender: Any object or :obj:`ANY`.  The decorated function
          will only receive :meth:`send` emissions sent by *sender*.  If
          ``ANY``, the receiver will always be notified.  A function may be
          decorated multiple times with differing *sender* values.

        :param weak: If true, the Signal will hold a weakref to the
          decorated function and automatically disconnect when *receiver*
          goes out of scope or is garbage collected.  Unlike
          :meth:`connect`, this defaults to False.

        The decorated function will be invoked by :meth:`send` with
          `sender=` as a single positional argument and any ``kwargs`` that
          were provided to the call to :meth:`send`.

        This is a context manager for use in the ``with`` statement.  It can
        be useful in unit tests.  *receiver* is connected to the signal for
        the duration of the ``with`` block, and will be disconnected
        automatically when exiting the block:

        Connecting & disconnecting leave behind a small amount of bookkeeping
        for the receiver and sender values. Typical workloads using Blinker,
        for example in most web apps, Flask, CLI scripts, etc., are not
        adversely affected by this bookkeeping.

        With a long-running Python process performing dynamic signal routing
        with high volume- e.g. connecting to function closures, "senders" are
        all unique object instances, and doing all of this over and over- you
        may see memory usage will grow due to extraneous bookkeeping. (An empty
        set() for each stale sender/receiver pair.)

        This method will prune that bookkeeping away, with the caveat that such
        pruning is not threadsafe. The risk is that cleanup of a fully
        disconnected receiver/sender pair occurs while another thread is
        connecting that same pair. If you are in the highly dynamic, unique
        receiver/sender situation that has lead you to this method, that

    added to it. If this is non-zero, each output line will be at most this
    many characters long.

    pad controls whether the input is padded to a multiple of 4 before

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of I/O events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a

        will be a reference to the active event loop, 'context'
        will be a dict object (see `call_exception_handler()`

        This default handler logs the error message and other

The event loop can be broken up into a multiplexer (the part
responsible for notifying us of I/O events) and the event loop proper,
which wraps a multiplexer with functionality for scheduling callbacks,
immediately or at a given time in the future.

Whenever a public API takes a callback, subsequent positional
arguments will be passed to the callback if/when it is called.  This
avoids the proliferation of trivial lambdas implementing closures.
Keyword arguments for the callback are not supported; this is a
conscious design decision, leaving the door open for keyword arguments
to modify the meaning of the API call itself.

        Clears the cache.  This method is not used by Jinja but should be
        implemented to allow applications to clear the bytecode cache used
        by a particular environment.
        get_cache_keyReturns the unique hash key for this template name.get_source_checksumReturns a checksum for the source.get_bucketReturn a cache bucket for the given template.  All arguments are

        set_bucketPut the bucket into the cache.A bytecode cache that stores bytecode on the filesystem.  It accepts
    two arguments: The directory where the cache items are stored and a
    pattern string that is used to build the filename.

    If no directory is specified a default cache directory is selected.  On
    Windows the user's temp directory is used, on UNIX systems a directory
    is created for the user in the system temp directory.

    The pattern can be used to have multiple separate caches operate on the
    same directory.  The default pattern is ``'__jinja2_%s.cache'``.  ``%s``
    is replaced with the cache key.

    storing the information.  It does not enforce a specific memcache library
    (tummy's memcache or cmemcache) but will accept any class that provides
    the minimal interface required.

    Libraries compatible with this class:

    -   `cachelib <https://github.com/pallets/cachelib>`_
    -   `python-memcached <https://pypi.org/project/python-memcached/>`_

    (Unfortunately the django cache interface is not compatible because it
    does not support storing binary data, only text. You can however pass
    the underlying cache client to the bytecode cache which is available
    as `django.core.cache.cache._client`.)

    The minimal interface for the client passed to the constructor is this:

    .. class:: MinimalClientInterface

        .. method:: set(key, value[, timeout])

            Stores the bytecode in the cache.  `value` is a string and
            `timeout` the timeout of the key.  If timeout is not provided
            a default timeout or no timeout should be assumed, if it's
            provided it's an integer with the number of seconds the cache
            item should exist.

        .. method:: get(key)

            Returns the value for the cache key.  If the item does not
            exist in the cache the return value must be `None`.

    The other arguments to the constructor are the prefix for all keys that
    is added before the actual cache key and the timeout for the bytecode in
    the cache system.  We recommend a high (or no) timeout.

    This bytecode cache does not support clearing of used items in the cache.
    The clear method is a no-operation function.

    This class takes care of details of the trace facility;
    a derived class should implement user interaction.
    The standard debugger class (pdb.Pdb) is an example.

    The optional skip argument must be an iterable of glob-style
    module name patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames
    that originate in a module that matches one of these patterns.
    Whether a frame is considered to originate in a certain module
    is determined by the __name__ in the frame globals.
    breaksfncacheframe_returningcanonicReturn canonical form of filename.

        For real filenames, the canonical form is a case-normalized (on
        case insensitive filesystems) absolute path.  'Filenames' with
        angle brackets, such as "<stdin>", generated in interactive
        mode, are returned unchanged.
        Set values of attributes as ready to start debugging.botframe_set_stopinfotrace_dispatchDispatch a trace function for debugged frames based on the event.

        This function is installed as the trace function for debugged
        frames. Its return value is the new trace function, which is
        usually itself. The default implementation decides how to
        dispatch a frame, depending on the type of event (passed in as a
        string) that is about to be executed.

        The event can be one of the following:
            line: A new line of code is going to be executed.
            call: A function is about to be called or another code block
                  is entered.
            return: A function or other code block is about to return.
            exception: An exception has occurred.
            c_call: A C function is about to be called.
            c_return: A C function has returned.
            c_exception: A C function has raised an exception.

        For the Python events, specialized functions (see the dispatch_*()
        methods) are called.  For the C events, no action is taken.

        The arg parameter depends on the previous event.

        Start debugging with a Bdb instance from the caller's frame.Breakpoint class.

    Implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and
    (re)-enabling, and conditionals.

    Breakpoints are indexed by number through bpbynumber and by
    the (file, line) tuple using bplist.  The former points to a
    single instance of class Breakpoint.  The latter points to a
    list of such instances since there may be more than one
    breakpoint per line.

    When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be
    in canonical form.  If funcname is defined, a breakpoint hit will be
    counted when the first line of that function is executed.  A
    conditional breakpoint always counts a hit.
    func_first_executable_linehitsDelete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file:line.

    first_registrationurl_prefixname_prefixurl_values_defaultsurl_defaultsA helper method to register a rule (and optionally a view function)
        to the application.  The endpoint is automatically prefixed with the
        blueprint's name.
        Represents a blueprint, a collection of routes and other
    app-related functions that can be registered on a real application
    later.

    A blueprint is an object that allows defining application functions
    without requiring an application object ahead of time. It uses the
    same decorators as :class:`~flask.Flask`, but defers the need for an
    application by recording them for later registration.

    Decorating a function with a blueprint creates a deferred function
    that is called with :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState`
    when the blueprint is registered on an application.

    See :doc:`/blueprints` for more information.

    :param name: The name of the blueprint. Will be prepended to each
        endpoint name.
    :param import_name: The name of the blueprint package, usually
        ``__name__``. This helps locate the ``root_path`` for the
        blueprint.
    :param static_folder: A folder with static files that should be
        served by the blueprint's static route. The path is relative to
        the blueprint's root path. Blueprint static files are disabled
        by default.
    :param static_url_path: The url to serve static files from.
        Defaults to ``static_folder``. If the blueprint does not have
        a ``url_prefix``, the app's static route will take precedence,
        and the blueprint's static files won't be accessible.
    :param template_folder: A folder with templates that should be added
        to the app's template search path. The path is relative to the
        blueprint's root path. Blueprint templates are disabled by
        default. Blueprint templates have a lower precedence than those
        in the app's templates folder.
    :param url_prefix: A path to prepend to all of the blueprint's URLs,
        to make them distinct from the rest of the app's routes.
    :param subdomain: A subdomain that blueprint routes will match on by
        default.
    :param url_defaults: A dict of default values that blueprint routes
        will receive by default.
    :param root_path: By default, the blueprint will automatically set
        this based on ``import_name``. In certain situations this
        automatic detection can fail, so the path can be specified
        manually instead.

This module provides a file interface, classes for incremental
(de)compression, and functions for one-shot (de)compression.
BZ2FileBZ2CompressorBZ2DecompressorcompressNadeem Vawda <nadeem.vawda@gmail.com>_builtin_open_compression_MODE_CLOSED_MODE_READ_MODE_WRITEA file object providing transparent bzip2 (de)compression.

    A BZ2File can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or refer
    directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that BZ2File provides a *binary* file interface - data read is
    returned as bytes, and data to be written should be given as bytes.
    compresslevelOpen a bzip2-compressed file.

        If filename is a str, bytes, or PathLike object, it gives the
        name of the file to be opened. Otherwise, it should be a file
        object, which will be used to read or write the compressed data.

        mode can be 'r' for reading (default), 'w' for (over)writing,
        'x' for creating exclusively, or 'a' for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as 'rb', 'wb', 'xb', and 'ab'.

        If mode is 'w', 'x' or 'a', compresslevel can be a number between 1
        and 9 specifying the level of compression: 1 produces the least
        compression, and 9 (default) produces the most compression.

        If mode is 'r', the input file may be the concatenation of
        multiple compressed streams.
        _closefpcompresslevel must be between 1 and 9mode_code_compressorxbabInvalid mode: %rfilename must be a str, bytes, file or PathLike objectFlush and close the file.

        May be called more than once without error. Once the file is
        closed, any other operation on it will raise a ValueError.
        True if this file is closed.Return the file descriptor for the underlying file.Return whether the file supports seeking.Return whether the file was opened for reading.Return whether the file was opened for writing.Return buffered data without advancing the file position.

        Always returns at least one byte of data, unless at EOF.
        The exact number of bytes returned is unspecified.
        Read up to size uncompressed bytes from the file.

        If size is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
        Returns b'' if the file is already at EOF.
        Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid
        making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a
        buffer's worth of data if size is negative.

        Returns b'' if the file is at EOF.
        Read bytes into b.

        Returns the number of bytes read (0 for EOF).
        Read a line of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        The terminating newline (if present) is retained. If size is
        non-negative, no more than size bytes will be read (in which
        case the line may be incomplete). Returns b'' if already at EOF.
        Integer argument expectedRead a list of lines of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        size can be specified to control the number of lines read: no
        further lines will be read once the total size of the lines read
        so far equals or exceeds size.
        Write a byte string to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always the length of data in bytes. Note that due to buffering,
        the file on disk may not reflect the data written until close()
        is called.
        compressedWrite a sequence of byte strings to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written.
        seq can be any iterable yielding byte strings.

        Line separators are not added between the written byte strings.
        Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default); offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str, bytes, or
    PathLike object), or an existing file object to read from or write
    to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or
    "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode.
    The default mode is "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the BZ2File
    constructor: BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case,
    the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a BZ2File object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

        arguments.

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.
    longMessage80maxDiff_diffThreshold_classSetupFailed_class_cleanupsCreate an instance of the class that will use the named test
           method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
           not have a method with the specified name.

        This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
        their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.

        Args:
            typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
                    are of the same type in assertEqual().
            function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
                    msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
                    useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
        Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is

        If longMessage is False this means:
        * Use only an explicit message if it is provided
        * Otherwise use the standard message for the assert

        If longMessage is True:
        * Use the standard message
        * If an explicit message is provided, plus ' : ' and the explicit message
        %s : %sexpected_exceptionFail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
           raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
           deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
           unexpected exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
           the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
           exception after the assertion::

               with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_exception = cm.exception
               self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
        assertWarnsexpected_warningFail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
           triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
           warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
           out, or raised as an exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
           warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
           and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
           of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
           This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::

               with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_warning = cm.warning
               self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
        assertLogsFail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
        on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
        INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.

        This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
        a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
        At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
        be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
        `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
        objects.

        Example::

            with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
                logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
                logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
            self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                                         'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
        _AssertLogsContext_getAssertEqualityFuncGet a detailed comparison function for the types of the two args.

        Returns: A callable accepting (first, second, msg=None) that will
        raise a failure exception if first != second with a useful human
        readable error message for those types.

    This is useful for slipping pre-existing test functions into the

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

Contains CCompiler, an abstract base class that defines the interface
for the Distutils compiler abstraction model.distutils.errorsdistutils.spawndistutils.file_utilmove_filedistutils.dir_utilmkpathdistutils.dep_utilnewer_groupdistutils.utilsplit_quotedexecuteCCompilerAbstract base class to define the interface that must be implemented
    by real compiler classes.  Also has some utility methods used by
    several compiler classes.

    The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each
    instance can be used for all the compile/link steps in building a
    single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile and
    link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries to link
    against, etc. -- are attributes of the compiler instance.  To allow for
    variability in how individual files are treated, most of those
    attributes may be varied on a per-compilation or per-link basis.
    src_extensionsobj_extensionstatic_lib_extensionshared_lib_extensionstatic_lib_formatshared_lib_formatexe_extension.cc++.cc.cpp.cxxobjc.mlanguage_maplanguage_orderoutput_dirmacrosinclude_dirslibrarieslibrary_dirsruntime_library_dirsset_executableset_executablesDefine the executables (and options for them) that will be run
        to perform the various stages of compilation.  The exact set of
        executables that may be specified here depends on the compiler
        class (via the 'executables' class attribute), but most will have:
          compiler      the C/C++ compiler
          linker_so     linker used to create shared objects and libraries
          linker_exe    linker used to create binary executables
          archiver      static library creator

        On platforms with a command-line (Unix, DOS/Windows), each of these
        is a string that will be split into executable name and (optional)
        list of arguments.  (Splitting the string is done similarly to how
        Unix shells operate: words are delimited by spaces, but quotes and
        backslashes can override this.  See
        'distutils.util.split_quoted()'.)
        unknown executable '%s' for class %s_find_macrodefn_check_macro_definitionsdefinitionsEnsures that every element of 'definitions' is a valid macro
        definition, ie. either (name,value) 2-tuple or a (name,) tuple.  Do
        nothing if all definitions are OK, raise TypeError otherwise.
        invalid macro definition '%s': must be tuple (string,), (string, string), or (string, None)define_macroDefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by this
        compiler object.  The optional parameter 'value' should be a
        string; if it is not supplied, then the macro will be defined
        without an explicit value and the exact outcome depends on the
        compiler used (XXX true? does ANSI say anything about this?)
        undefine_macroUndefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by
        this compiler object.  If the same macro is defined by
        'define_macro()' and undefined by 'undefine_macro()' the last call
        takes precedence (including multiple redefinitions or
        undefinitions).  If the macro is redefined/undefined on a
        per-compilation basis (ie. in the call to 'compile()'), then that
        takes precedence.
        undefnadd_include_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        header files.  The compiler is instructed to search directories in
        the order in which they are supplied by successive calls to
        'add_include_dir()'.
        set_include_dirsSet the list of directories that will be searched to 'dirs' (a
        list of strings).  Overrides any preceding calls to
        'add_include_dir()'; subsequence calls to 'add_include_dir()' add
        to the list passed to 'set_include_dirs()'.  This does not affect
        any list of standard include directories that the compiler may
        search by default.
        add_libraryAdd 'libname' to the list of libraries that will be included in
        all links driven by this compiler object.  Note that 'libname'
        should *not* be the name of a file containing a library, but the
        name of the library itself: the actual filename will be inferred by
        the linker, the compiler, or the compiler class (depending on the
        platform).

        The linker will be instructed to link against libraries in the
        order they were supplied to 'add_library()' and/or
        'set_libraries()'.  It is perfectly valid to duplicate library
        names; the linker will be instructed to link against libraries as
        many times as they are mentioned.
        set_librariesSet the list of libraries to be included in all links driven by
        this compiler object to 'libnames' (a list of strings).  This does
        not affect any standard system libraries that the linker may
        include by default.
        add_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        libraries specified to 'add_library()' and 'set_libraries()'.  The
        linker will be instructed to search for libraries in the order they
        are supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or 'set_library_dirs()'.
        set_library_dirsSet the list of library search directories to 'dirs' (a list of
        strings).  This does not affect any standard library search path
        that the linker may search by default.
        add_runtime_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        shared libraries at runtime.
        set_runtime_library_dirsSet the list of directories to search for shared libraries at
        runtime to 'dirs' (a list of strings).  This does not affect any
        standard search path that the runtime linker may search by
        default.
        add_link_objectAdd 'object' to the list of object files (or analogues, such as
        explicitly named library files or the output of "resource
        compilers") to be included in every link driven by this compiler
        object.
        set_link_objectsSet the list of object files (or analogues) to be included in
        every link to 'objects'.  This does not affect any standard object
        files that the linker may include by default (such as system
        libraries).

        is a list, and augments it with 'self.macros'; ensures that
        'include_dirs' is a list, and augments it with 'self.include_dirs'.
        Guarantees that the returned values are of the correct type,
        i.e. for 'output_dir' either string or None, and for 'macros' and
        'include_dirs' either list or None.

        Determine the list of object files corresponding to 'sources',

        Output will be written to file named 'output_file', or stdout if
        'output_file' not supplied.  'macros' is a list of macro
        definitions as for 'compile()', which will augment the macros set
        with 'define_macro()' and 'undefine_macro()'.  'include_dirs' is a
        list of directory names that will be added to the default list.

        Raises PreprocessError on failure.
        Compile one or more source files.

        'sources' must be a list of filenames, most likely C/C++
        files, but in reality anything that can be handled by a
        particular compiler and compiler class (eg. MSVCCompiler can
        handle resource files in 'sources').  Return a list of object
        filenames, one per source filename in 'sources'.  Depending on
        the implementation, not all source files will necessarily be
        compiled, but all corresponding object filenames will be
        returned.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to
        "build/foo/bar.o".

        'macros', if given, must be a list of macro definitions.  A macro
        definition is either a (name, value) 2-tuple or a (name,) 1-tuple.
        The former defines a macro; if the value is None, the macro is
        defined without an explicit value.  The 1-tuple case undefines a
        macro.  Later definitions/redefinitions/ undefinitions take
        precedence.

        'include_dirs', if given, must be a list of strings, the
        directories to add to the default include file search path for this
        compilation only.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, the compiler will be instructed to
        output debug symbols in (or alongside) the object file(s).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are implementation- dependent.
        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,
        DOS/Windows), they are most likely lists of strings: extra
        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch
        for those occasions when the abstract compiler framework doesn't
        cut the mustard.

        'depends', if given, is a list of filenames that all targets
        depend on.  If a source file is older than any file in
        depends, then the source file will be recompiled.  This
        supports dependency tracking, but only at a coarse
        granularity.

        Raises CompileError on failure.
        _compileCompile 'src' to product 'obj'.create_static_liboutput_libnametarget_langLink a bunch of stuff together to create a static library file.
        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects', the extra object files supplied to
        'add_link_object()' and/or 'set_link_objects()', the libraries
        supplied to 'add_library()' and/or 'set_libraries()', and the
        libraries supplied as 'libraries' (if any).

        'output_libname' should be a library name, not a filename; the
        filename will be inferred from the library name.  'output_dir' is
        the directory where the library file will be put.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, debugging information will be
        included in the library (note that on most platforms, it is the
        compile step where this matters: the 'debug' flag is included here
        just for consistency).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LibError on failure.
        shared_objectSHARED_OBJECTshared_librarySHARED_LIBRARYEXECUTABLEtarget_descoutput_filenameexport_symbolsbuild_tempLink a bunch of stuff together to create an executable or
        shared library file.

        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects'.  'output_filename' should be a filename.  If
        'output_dir' is supplied, 'output_filename' is relative to it
        (i.e. 'output_filename' can provide directory components if
        needed).

        'libraries' is a list of libraries to link against.  These are
        library names, not filenames, since they're translated into
        filenames in a platform-specific way (eg. "foo" becomes "libfoo.a"
        on Unix and "foo.lib" on DOS/Windows).  However, they can include a
        directory component, which means the linker will look in that
        specific directory rather than searching all the normal locations.

        'library_dirs', if supplied, should be a list of directories to
        search for libraries that were specified as bare library names
        (ie. no directory component).  These are on top of the system
        default and those supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or
        'set_library_dirs()'.  'runtime_library_dirs' is a list of
        directories that will be embedded into the shared library and used
        to search for other shared libraries that *it* depends on at
        run-time.  (This may only be relevant on Unix.)

        'export_symbols' is a list of symbols that the shared library will
        export.  (This appears to be relevant only on Windows.)

        'debug' is as for 'compile()' and 'create_static_lib()', with the
        slight distinction that it actually matters on most platforms (as
        opposed to 'create_static_lib()', which includes a 'debug' flag
        mostly for form's sake).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are as for 'compile()' (except
        of course that they supply command-line arguments for the
        particular linker being used).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LinkError on failure.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to
        "build/foo/bar.o".

        'macros', if given, must be a list of macro definitions.  A macro
        definition is either a (name, value) 2-tuple or a (name,) 1-tuple.
        The former defines a macro; if the value is None, the macro is
        defined without an explicit value.  The 1-tuple case undefines a
        macro.  Later definitions/redefinitions/ undefinitions take
        precedence.

        'include_dirs', if given, must be a list of strings, the
        directories to add to the default include file search path for this
        compilation only.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, the compiler will be instructed to
        output debug symbols in (or alongside) the object file(s).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are implementation- dependent.
        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,
        DOS/Windows), they are most likely lists of strings: extra
        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch
        for those occasions when the abstract compiler framework doesn't
        cut the mustard.

        'depends', if given, is a list of filenames that all targets
        depend on.  If a source file is older than any file in
        depends, then the source file will be recompiled.  This
        supports dependency tracking, but only at a coarse
        granularity.

        Raises CompileError on failure.
        'u'Compile one or more source files.

        'sources' must be a list of filenames, most likely C/C++
        files, but in reality anything that can be handled by a
        particular compiler and compiler class (eg. MSVCCompiler can
        handle resource files in 'sources').  Return a list of object
        filenames, one per source filename in 'sources'.  Depending on
        the implementation, not all source files will necessarily be
        compiled, but all corresponding object filenames will be
        returned.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to

    charset is the input character set, and must be the canonical name of a
    character set.

    Optional header_enc and body_enc is either Charset.QP for
    quoted-printable, Charset.BASE64 for base64 encoding, Charset.SHORTEST for
    the shortest of qp or base64 encoding, or None for no encoding.  SHORTEST
    is only valid for header_enc.  It describes how message headers and
    message bodies in the input charset are to be encoded.  Default is no
    encoding.

    Optional output_charset is the character set that the output should be
    in.  Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the
    output charset when the method Charset.convert() is called.  The default
    is to output in the same character set as the input.

    Both input_charset and output_charset must have Unicode codec entries in
    the module's charset-to-codec mapping; use add_codec(charset, codecname)
    to add codecs the module does not know about.  See the codecs module's
    documentation for more information.
    SHORTEST not allowed for body_encAdd a character set alias.

    alias is the alias name, e.g. latin-1
    canonical is the character set's canonical name, e.g. iso-8859-1
    codecnameAdd a codec that map characters in the given charset to/from Unicode.

    charset is the canonical name of a character set.  codecname is the name
    of a Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument to the unicode()
    built-in, or to the encode() method of a Unicode string.
    _encodecodecMap character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email
    for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for
    converting between character sets, given the availability of the
    applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it will do its best to provide
    information on how to use that character set in an email in an
    RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
    when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be
    converted outright, and are not allowed in email.  Instances of this
    module expose the following information about a character set:

    input_charset: The initial character set specified.  Common aliases
                   are converted to their `official' email names (e.g. latin_1
                   is converted to iso-8859-1).  Defaults to 7-bit us-ascii.

    header_encoding: If the character set must be encoded before it can be
                     used in an email header, this attribute will be set to
                     Charset.QP (for quoted-printable), Charset.BASE64 (for
                     base64 encoding), or Charset.SHORTEST for the shortest of
                     QP or BASE64 encoding.  Otherwise, it will be None.

    body_encoding: Same as header_encoding, but describes the encoding for the
                   mail message's body, which indeed may be different than the
                   header encoding.  Charset.SHORTEST is not allowed for
                   body_encoding.

    output_charset: Some character sets must be converted before they can be
                    used in email headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is
                    one of them, this attribute will contain the name of the
                    charset output will be converted to.  Otherwise, it will
                    be None.

    input_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert the
                 input_charset to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is
                 necessary, this attribute will be None.

    output_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode
                  to the output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary,
                  this attribute will have the same value as the input_codec.
    input_charsethencbencheader_encodingbody_encodinginput_codecoutput_codecget_body_encodingReturn the content-transfer-encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable' or `base64' depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function in which case you should call
        the function with a single argument, the Message object being
        encoded.  The function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on

        output charset is a 7bit encoding, so re-encoding the decoded
        string using the ascii codec produces the correct string version
        of the content.

    'b'Map character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email
    for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for
    converting between character sets, given the availability of the
    applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it will do its best to provide
    information on how to use that character set in an email in an
    RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
    when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be
    converted outright, and are not allowed in email.  Instances of this
    module expose the following information about a character set:

    input_charset: The initial character set specified.  Common aliases
                   are converted to their `official' email names (e.g. latin_1
                   is converted to iso-8859-1).  Defaults to 7-bit us-ascii.

HTTPConnection goes through a number of "states", which define when a client
may legally make another request or fetch the response for a particular
request. This diagram details these state transitions:

                          Request-sent

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

        Look through the list of headers and find all lines matching a given
        header name (and their continuation lines).  A list of the lines is
        returned, without interpretation.  If the header does not occur, an
        empty list is returned.  If the header occurs multiple times, all
        occurrences are returned.  Case is not important in the header name.

        hit_read_headersReads potential header lines into a list from a file pointer.

    Length of line is limited by _MAXLINE, and number of
    headers is limited by _MAXHEADERS.
    header linegot more than %d headersparse_headers_classParses only RFC2822 headers from a file pointer.

    email Parser wants to see strings rather than bytes.
    But a TextIOWrapper around self.rfile would buffer too many bytes
    from the stream, bytes which we later need to read as bytes.
    So we read the correct bytes here, as bytes, for email Parser
    to parse.

        Normally, we have a blocking socket, but a read() can be interrupted
        by a signal (resulting in a partial read).

        Note that we cannot distinguish between EOF and an interrupt when zero
        bytes have been read. IncompleteRead() will be raised in this
        situation.

        This function should be used when <amt> bytes "should" be present for
        reading. If the bytes are truly not available (due to EOF), then the
        IncompleteRead exception can be used to detect the problem.
        Same as _safe_read, but for reading into a buffer.Read with at most one underlying system call.  If at least one
        byte is buffered, return that instead.
        _read1_chunked_peek_chunkedgetheaderReturns the value of the header matching *name*.

        If there are multiple matching headers, the values are
        combined into a single string separated by commas and spaces.

        If no matching header is found, returns *default* or None if
        the *default* is not specified.

        If the headers are unknown, raises http.client.ResponseNotReady.

        getheadersReturn list of (header, value) tuples.Returns an instance of the class mimetools.Message containing
        meta-information associated with the URL.

        When the method is HTTP, these headers are those returned by
        the server at the head of the retrieved HTML page (including
        Content-Length and Content-Type).

        When the method is FTP, a Content-Length header will be
        present if (as is now usual) the server passed back a file
        length in response to the FTP retrieval request. A
        Content-Type header will be present if the MIME type can be
        guessed.

        When the method is local-file, returned headers will include
        a Date representing the file's last-modified time, a
        Content-Length giving file size, and a Content-Type
        containing a guess at the file's type. See also the
        description of the mimetools module.

        geturlReturn the real URL of the page.

        In some cases, the HTTP server redirects a client to another
        URL. The urlopen() function handles this transparently, but in
        some cases the caller needs to know which URL the client was
        redirected to. The geturl() method can be used to get at this
        redirected URL.

        getcodeReturn the HTTP status code that was sent with the response,
        or None if the URL is not an HTTP URL.

        _http_vsnHTTP/1.1_http_vsn_strdefault_portauto_open_is_textIOTest whether a file-like object is a text or a binary stream.
        TextIOBase_get_content_lengthGet the content-length based on the body.

        If the body is None, we set Content-Length: 0 for methods that expect
        a body (RFC 7230, Section 3.3.2). We also set the Content-Length for
        any method if the body is a str or bytes-like object and not a file.
        mv_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUTsource_address__response__state_tunnel_host_tunnel_port_tunnel_headers_get_hostport_validate_host_create_connectionset_tunnelSet up host and port for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling.

        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the
        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to
        the endpoint passed to `set_tunnel`. This done by sending an HTTP
        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.

        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been
        established.

        The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send
        with the CONNECT request.

        If the HTTPConnection is in the correct state, returns an
        instance of HTTPResponse or of whatever object is returned by
        the response_class variable.

        If a request has not been sent or if a previous response has
        not be handled, ResponseNotReady is raised.  If the HTTP
        response indicates that the connection should be closed, then
        it will be closed before the response is returned.  When the
        connection is closed, the underlying socket is closed.

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

    Methods can be added to the MultiCall using normal
    method call syntax e.g.:

    multicall = MultiCall(server_proxy)
    multicall.add(2,3)
    multicall.get_address("Guido")

    To execute the multicall, call the MultiCall object e.g.:

    mkdatetimemkbytesmethodnamemethodresponsedata [,options] -> marshalled data

    Convert an argument tuple or a Fault instance to an XML-RPC
    request (or response, if the methodresponse option is used).

    In addition to the data object, the following options can be given
    as keyword arguments:

        methodname: the method name for a methodCall packet

        methodresponse: true to create a methodResponse packet.
        If this option is used with a tuple, the tuple must be
        a singleton (i.e. it can contain only one element).

        encoding: the packet encoding (default is UTF-8)

    All byte strings in the data structure are assumed to use the
    packet encoding.  Unicode strings are automatically converted,
    where necessary.

data -> unmarshalled data, method name

    Convert an XML-RPC packet to unmarshalled data plus a method
    name (None if not present).

    If the XML-RPC packet represents a fault condition, this function
    raises a Fault exception.
    gzip_encodedata -> gzip encoded data

    Encode data using the gzip content encoding as described in RFC 1952

    uri is the connection point on the server, given as
    scheme://host/target.

    The standard implementation always supports the "http" scheme.  If
    SSL socket support is available (Python 2.0), it also supports
    "https".

    If the target part and the slash preceding it are both omitted,
    "/RPC2" is assumed.

    The following options can be given as keyword arguments:

        transport: a transport factory
        encoding: the request encoding (default is UTF-8)

    All 8-bit strings passed to the server proxy are assumed to use
    the given encoding.

Interpreters constructed with this class obey the following conventions:

1. End of file on input is processed as the command 'EOF'.
2. A command is parsed out of each line by collecting the prefix composed
   of characters in the identchars member.
3. A command `foo' is dispatched to a method 'do_foo()'; the do_ method
   is passed a single argument consisting of the remainder of the line.
4. Typing an empty line repeats the last command.  (Actually, it calls the
   method `emptyline', which may be overridden in a subclass.)
5. There is a predefined `help' method.  Given an argument `topic', it
   calls the command `help_topic'.  With no arguments, it lists all topics
   with defined help_ functions, broken into up to three topics; documented
   commands, miscellaneous help topics, and undocumented commands.
6. The command '?' is a synonym for `help'.  The command '!' is a synonym
   for `shell', if a do_shell method exists.
7. If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically,
   and completing of commands args is done by calling complete_foo() with
   arguments text, line, begidx, endidx.  text is string we are matching
   against, all returned matches must begin with it.  line is the current
   input line (lstripped), begidx and endidx are the beginning and end
   indexes of the text being matched, which could be used to provide
   different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

The `default' method may be overridden to intercept commands for which there
is no do_ method.

The `completedefault' method may be overridden to intercept completions for
commands that have no complete_ method.

The data member `self.ruler' sets the character used to draw separator lines
in the help messages.  If empty, no ruler line is drawn.  It defaults to "=".

If the value of `self.intro' is nonempty when the cmdloop method is called,
it is printed out on interpreter startup.  This value may be overridden
via an optional argument to the cmdloop() method.

The data members `self.doc_header', `self.misc_header', and
`self.undoc_header' set the headers used for the help function's
listings of documented functions, miscellaneous topics, and undocumented
functions respectively.

        is done automatically. The optional arguments stdin and stdout

codeopCommandCompilercompile_commandInteractiveInterpreterInteractiveConsoleBase class for InteractiveConsole.

    This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's
    namespace); it doesn't deal with input buffering or prompting or
    input file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly).

    Constructor.

        The optional 'locals' argument specifies the dictionary in
        which code will be executed; it defaults to a newly created
        dictionary with key "__name__" set to "__console__" and key
        "__doc__" set to None.

        __console__runsource<input>Compile and run some source in the interpreter.

        Arguments are as for compile_command().

        One of several things can happen:

        1) The input is incorrect; compile_command() raised an
        exception (SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback
        will be printed by calling the showsyntaxerror() method.

        2) The input is incomplete, and more input is required;
        compile_command() returned None.  Nothing happens.

        3) The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code
        object.  The code is executed by calling self.runcode() (which
        also handles run-time exceptions, except for SystemExit).

        The return value is True in case 2, False in the other cases (unless
        an exception is raised).  The return value can be used to
        decide whether to use sys.ps1 or sys.ps2 to prompt the next
        line.

        showsyntaxerrorruncodeExecute a code object.

        When an exception occurs, self.showtraceback() is called to
        display a traceback.  All exceptions are caught except
        SystemExit, which is reraised.

        A note about KeyboardInterrupt: this exception may occur
        elsewhere in this code, and may not always be caught.  The
        caller should be prepared to deal with it.

        showtracebackDisplay the syntax error that just occurred.

        This doesn't display a stack trace because there isn't one.

        If a filename is given, it is stuffed in the exception instead
        of what was there before (because Python's parser always uses
        "<string>" when reading from a string).

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

    This class builds on InteractiveInterpreter and adds prompting

    <console>Constructor.

        The optional locals argument will be passed to the
        InteractiveInterpreter base class.

        The optional filename argument should specify the (file)name
        of the input stream; it will show up in tracebacks.

        resetbufferReset the input buffer.exitmsgClosely emulate the interactive Python console.

        The optional banner argument specifies the banner to print
        before the first interaction; by default it prints a banner
        similar to the one printed by the real Python interpreter,
        followed by the current class name in parentheses (so as not
        to confuse this with the real interpreter -- since it's so
        close!).

        The optional exitmsg argument specifies the exit message
        printed when exiting. Pass the empty string to suppress
        printing an exit message. If exitmsg is not given or None,
        a default message is printed.

Push a line to the interpreter.

        The line should not have a trailing newline; it may have
        internal newlines.  The line is appended to a buffer and the
        interpreter's runsource() method is called with the
        concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this
        indicates that the command was executed or invalid, the buffer
        is reset; otherwise, the command is incomplete, and the buffer
        is left as it was after the line was appended.  The return
        value is 1 if more input is required, 0 if the line was dealt
        with in some way (this is the same as runsource()).

        Write a prompt and read a line.

        The returned line does not include the trailing newline.
        When the user enters the EOF key sequence, EOFError is raised.

        The base implementation uses the built-in function
        input(); a subclass may replace this with a different
        implementation.

        readfuncClosely emulate the interactive Python interpreter.

    This is a backwards compatible interface to the InteractiveConsole
    class.  When readfunc is not specified, it attempts to import the
    readline module to enable GNU readline if it is available.

    Arguments (all optional, all default to None):

    banner -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()
    readfunc -- if not None, replaces InteractiveConsole.raw_input()

        The .encode()/.decode() methods may use different error
        handling schemes by providing the errors argument. These
        string values are predefined:

         'strict' - raise a ValueError error (or a subclass)
         'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
         'replace' - replace with a suitable replacement character;
                    Python will use the official U+FFFD REPLACEMENT
                    CHARACTER for the builtin Unicode codecs on
                    decoding and '?' on encoding.
         'surrogateescape' - replace with private code points U+DCnn.
         'xmlcharrefreplace' - Replace with the appropriate XML
                               character reference (only for encoding).
         'backslashreplace'  - Replace with backslashed escape sequences.
         'namereplace'       - Replace with \N{...} escape sequences
                               (only for encoding).

        The set of allowed values can be extended via register_error.

     Encodes the object input and returns a tuple (output
            object, length consumed).

            errors defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to
            'strict' handling.

            The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use
            StreamWriter for codecs which have to keep state in order to
            make encoding efficient.

            The encoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

         Decodes the object input and returns a tuple (output
            object, length consumed).

            input must be an object which provides the bf_getreadbuf
            buffer slot. Python strings, buffer objects and memory
            mapped files are examples of objects providing this slot.

            errors defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to
            'strict' handling.

            The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use
            StreamReader for codecs which have to keep state in order to

            The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

        Set the current state of the encoder. state must have been
        returned by getstate().
        BufferedIncrementalEncoder
    This subclass of IncrementalEncoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental encoder if the encoder must keep some of the output in a
    buffer between calls to encode().

        Return the current state of the decoder.

        This must be a (buffered_input, additional_state_info) tuple.
        buffered_input must be a bytes object containing bytes that
        were passed to decode() that have not yet been converted.
        additional_state_info must be a non-negative integer
        representing the state of the decoder WITHOUT yet having
        processed the contents of buffered_input.  In the initial state
        and after reset(), getstate() must return (b"", 0).
        
        Set the current state of the decoder.

        state must have been returned by getstate().  The effect of
        setstate((b"", 0)) must be equivalent to reset().
        BufferedIncrementalDecoder
    This subclass of IncrementalDecoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental decoder if the decoder must be able to handle incomplete
    byte sequences.
    _buffer_decode Creates a StreamWriter instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for writing.

            The StreamWriter may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'xmlcharrefreplace' - Replace with the appropriate XML
                                   character reference.
             'backslashreplace'  - Replace with backslashed escape
                                   sequences.
             'namereplace'       - Replace with \N{...} escape sequences.

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
         Writes the object's contents encoded to self.stream.
         Writes the concatenated list of strings to the stream
            using .write().
         Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state.

            Calling this method should ensure that the data on the
            output is put into a clean state, that allows appending
            of new fresh data without having to rescan the whole
            stream to recover state.

         Inherit all other methods from the underlying stream.
        charbuffertype Creates a StreamReader instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for reading.

            The StreamReader may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'backslashreplace' - Replace with backslashed escape sequences;

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
        bytebuffer_empty_charbuffercharbufferlinebufferfirstline Decodes data from the stream self.stream and returns the
            resulting object.

            chars indicates the number of decoded code points or bytes to
            return. read() will never return more data than requested,
            but it might return less, if there is not enough available.

            size indicates the approximate maximum number of decoded
            bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder
            can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value
            -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible.  size
            is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one
            step.

            If firstline is true, and a UnicodeDecodeError happens
            after the first line terminator in the input only the first line
            will be returned, the rest of the input will be kept until the
            next call to read().

            The method should use a greedy read strategy, meaning that
            it should read as much data as is allowed within the
            definition of the encoding and the given size, e.g.  if
            optional encoding endings or state markers are available
            on the stream, these should be read too.
        newdatanewcharsdecodedbytes Read one line from the input stream and return the
            decoded data.

            size, if given, is passed as size argument to the
            read() method.

        72readsizeline0withendline0withoutend8000sizehint Read all lines available on the input stream
            and return them as a list.

            Line breaks are implemented using the codec's decoder
            method and are included in the list entries.

            way to finding the true end-of-line.

         Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state.

            Note that no stream repositioning should take place.
            This method is primarily intended to be able to recover
            from decoding errors.

         Set the input stream's current position.

            Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
         Return the next decoded line from the input stream. StreamReaderWriter instances allow wrapping streams which
        work in both read and write modes.

        The design is such that one can use the factory functions
        returned by the codec.lookup() function to construct the
        instance.

    unknownReaderWriter Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance.

            stream must be a Stream-like object.

            Reader, Writer must be factory functions or classes
            providing the StreamReader, StreamWriter interface resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

         StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

    data_encodingfile_encoding Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way
            conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend (the
            data visible to .read() and .write()) while Reader and Writer
            work on the backend (the data in stream).

            You can use these objects to do transparent
            transcodings from e.g. latin-1 to utf-8 and back.

            stream must be a file-like object.

            encode and decode must adhere to the Codec interface; Reader and
            Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the
            StreamReader and StreamWriter interfaces resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        bytesencodedbytesdecodedbuffering Open an encoded file using the given mode and return
        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.

        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format
        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin
        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the
        file.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.
        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will
        be used.

        The returned wrapped file object provides an extra attribute
        .encoding which allows querying the used encoding. This
        attribute is only available if an encoding was specified as
        parameter.

    srw Return a wrapped version of file which provides transparent
        encoding translation.

        Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according
        to the given data_encoding and then encoded to the underlying
        file using file_encoding. The intermediate data type
        will usually be Unicode but depends on the specified codecs.

        Bytes read from the file are decoded using file_encoding and then
        passed back to the caller encoded using data_encoding.

        If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        The returned wrapped file object provides two extra attributes
        .data_encoding and .file_encoding which reflect the given
        parameters of the same name. The attributes can be used for
        introspection by Python programs.

    data_infofile_infosr Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its encoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its decoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

        its IncrementalEncoder class or factory function.

        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental encoder.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalDecoder class or factory function.

    Encoding iterator.

    Encodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalEncoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalEncoder
    constructor.
    
    Decoding iterator.

    Decodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalDecoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalDecoder
    constructor.
    make_identity_dictrng make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    make_encoding_mapdecoding_map Creates an encoding map from a decoding map.

        If a target mapping in the decoding map occurs multiple
        times, then that target is mapped to None (undefined mapping),
        causing an exception when encountered by the charmap codec
        during translation.

        One example where this happens is cp875.py which decodes
        multiple character to \u001a.

            size indicates the approximate maximum number of decoded
            bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder
            can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value
            -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible.  size

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using

        'b' Open an encoded file using the given mode and return
        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.

        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format
        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin
        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the
        file.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an

        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.
        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will

    'b'namereplace'u'namereplace'u'Python.Python39.lib.codecs'u'Python39.lib.codecs'u'lib.codecs'u'codecs'Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

Approach:

First, check if the source consists entirely of blank lines and
comments; if so, replace it with 'pass', because the built-in
parser doesn't always do the right thing for these.

Compile three times: as is, with \n, and with \n\n appended.  If it
compiles as is, it's complete.  If it compiles with one \n appended,
we expect more.  If it doesn't compile either way, we compare the
error we get when compiling with \n or \n\n appended.  If the errors
are the same, the code is broken.  But if the errors are different, we
expect more.  Not intuitive; not even guaranteed to hold in future
releases; but this matches the compiler's behavior from Python 1.4
through 2.2, at least.

Caveat:

It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this
case, trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.
For example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by
arbitrary garbage.  This will be fixed once the API for the parser is
better.

The two interfaces are:

compile_command(source, filename, symbol):

CommandCompiler():

    Instances of this class have __call__ methods identical in

    instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement,
    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

The module also provides another class:

case, trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.
For example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by
arbitrary garbage.  This will be fixed once the API for the parser is
better.

The two interfaces are:

compile_command(source, filename, symbol):

    Compiles a single command in the manner described above.

CommandCompiler():

    Instances of this class have __call__ methods identical in
    signature to compile_command; the difference is that if the
    instance compiles program text containing a __future__ statement,
    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

The module also provides another class:

Compile():

    Instances of this class act like the built-in function compile,
    but with 'memory' in the sense described above.
'u'Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

Approach:

First, check if the source consists entirely of blank lines and
comments; if so, replace it with 'pass', because the built-in
parser doesn't always do the right thing for these.

Compile three times: as is, with \n, and with \n\n appended.  If it
compiles as is, it's complete.  If it compiles with one \n appended,
we expect more.  If it doesn't compile either way, we compare the
error we get when compiling with \n or \n\n appended.  If the errors
are the same, the code is broken.  But if the errors are different, we
expect more.  Not intuitive; not even guaranteed to hold in future
releases; but this matches the compiler's behavior from Python 1.4
through 2.2, at least.

Caveat:

    or special dictionaries.  There are two common patterns to populate the
    config.

    Either you can fill the config from a config file::

        app.config.from_pyfile('yourconfig.cfg')

    Or alternatively you can define the configuration options in the
    module that calls :meth:`from_object` or provide an import path to
    a module that should be loaded.  It is also possible to tell it to
    use the same module and with that provide the configuration values
    just before the call::

        DEBUG = True
        SECRET_KEY = 'development key'
        app.config.from_object(__name__)

    In both cases (loading from any Python file or loading from modules),
    only uppercase keys are added to the config.  This makes it possible to use
    lowercase values in the config file for temporary values that are not added
    to the config or to define the config keys in the same file that implements
    the application.

    Probably the most interesting way to load configurations is from an
    environment variable pointing to a file::

        app.config.from_envvar('YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS')

    In this case before launching the application you have to set this
    environment variable to the file you want to use.  On Linux and OS X
    use the export statement::

        export YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS='/path/to/config/file'

    On windows use `set` instead.

    :param root_path: path to which files are read relative from.  When the
                      config object is created by the application, this is
                      the application's :attr:`~flask.Flask.root_path`.
    :param defaults: an optional dictionary of default values
    from_envvarvariable_nameLoads a configuration from an environment variable pointing to
        a configuration file.  This is basically just a shortcut with nicer
        error messages for this line of code::

            app.config.from_pyfile(os.environ['YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS'])

        :param variable_name: name of the environment variable
        :param silent: set to ``True`` if you want silent failure for missing
                       files.
        :return: ``True`` if the file was loaded successfully.
        The environment variable  is not set and as such configuration could not be loaded. Set this variable and make it point to a configuration file" is not set"" and as such configuration could not be loaded. Set"" this variable and make it point to a configuration"" file"from_pyfilefrom_prefixed_envLoad any environment variables that start with ``FLASK_``,
        dropping the prefix from the env key for the config key. Values
        are passed through a loading function to attempt to convert them
        to more specific types than strings.

        Keys are loaded in :func:`sorted` order.

        The default loading function attempts to parse values as any
        valid JSON type, including dicts and lists.

        Specific items in nested dicts can be set by separating the
        keys with double underscores (``__``). If an intermediate key
        doesn't exist, it will be initialized to an empty dict.

        :param prefix: Load env vars that start with this prefix,
            separated with an underscore (``_``).
        :param loads: Pass each string value to this function and use
            the returned value as the config value. If any error is
            raised it is ignored and the value remains a string. The
            default is :func:`json.loads`.

        .. versionadded:: 2.1
        len_prefixUpdates the values in the config from a Python file.  This function
        behaves as if the file was imported as module with the
        :meth:`from_object` function.

        :param filename: the filename of the config.  This can either be an
                         absolute filename or a filename relative to the
                         root path.
        :param silent: set to ``True`` if you want silent failure for missing
                       files.
        :return: ``True`` if the file was loaded successfully.

        .. versionadded:: 0.7
           `silent` parameter.
        config_fileENOENTEISDIRENOTDIRUnable to load configuration file (from_objectUpdates the values from the given object.  An object can be of one
        of the following two types:

        -   a string: in this case the object with that name will be imported
        -   an actual object reference: that object is used directly

        Objects are usually either modules or classes. :meth:`from_object`
        loads only the uppercase attributes of the module/class. A ``dict``
        object will not work with :meth:`from_object` because the keys of a
        ``dict`` are not attributes of the ``dict`` class.

        Example of module-based configuration::

            app.config.from_object('yourapplication.default_config')
            from yourapplication import default_config
            app.config.from_object(default_config)

        Nothing is done to the object before loading. If the object is a
        class and has ``@property`` attributes, it needs to be
        instantiated before being passed to this method.

        You should not use this function to load the actual configuration but
        rather configuration defaults.  The actual config should be loaded
        with :meth:`from_pyfile` and ideally from a location not within the
        package because the package might be installed system wide.

        See :ref:`config-dev-prod` for an example of class-based configuration
        using :meth:`from_object`.

        :param obj: an import name or object
        Update the values in the config from a file that is loaded
        using the ``load`` parameter. The loaded data is passed to the
        :meth:`from_mapping` method.

        .. code-block:: python

            import json
            app.config.from_file("config.json", load=json.load)

            import tomllib
            app.config.from_file("config.toml", load=tomllib.load, text=False)

        :param filename: The path to the data file. This can be an
            absolute path or relative to the config root path.
        :param load: A callable that takes a file handle and returns a
            mapping of loaded data from the file.
        :type load: ``Callable[[Reader], Mapping]`` where ``Reader``
            implements a ``read`` method.
        :param silent: Ignore the file if it doesn't exist.
        :param text: Open the file in text or binary mode.
        :return: ``True`` if the file was loaded successfully.

        mappingsget_namespacelowercasetrim_namespaceReturns a dictionary containing a subset of configuration options
        that match the specified namespace/prefix. Example usage::

            app.config['IMAGE_STORE_TYPE'] = 'fs'
            app.config['IMAGE_STORE_PATH'] = '/var/app/images'
            app.config['IMAGE_STORE_BASE_URL'] = 'http://img.website.com'
            image_store_config = app.config.get_namespace('IMAGE_STORE_')

        The resulting dictionary `image_store_config` would look like::

            {
                'type': 'fs',
                'path': '/var/app/images',
                'base_url': 'http://img.website.com'
            }

        This is often useful when configuration options map directly to
        keyword arguments in functions or class constructors.

    Either you can fill the config from a config file::

        app.config.from_pyfile('yourconfig.cfg')

    Or alternatively you can define the configuration options in the
    module that calls :meth:`from_object` or provide an import path to
    a module that should be loaded.  It is also possible to tell it to
    use the same module and with that provide the configuration values
    just before the call::

        app.config.from_object(__name__)

    In both cases (loading from any Python file or loading from modules),
    only uppercase keys are added to the config.  This makes it possible to use
    lowercase values in the config file for temporary values that are not added
    to the config or to define the config keys in the same file that implements
    the application.

    Probably the most interesting way to load configurations is from an
    environment variable pointing to a file::

        app.config.from_envvar('YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS')

    In this case before launching the application you have to set this
    environment variable to the file you want to use.  On Linux and OS X
    use the export statement::

        export YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS='/path/to/config/file'

        'u'flask.config'Configuration file parser.

A configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations and such in
the style of RFC 822.

Intrinsic defaults can be specified by passing them into the
ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary.

class:

ConfigParser -- responsible for parsing a list of
                    configuration files, and managing the parsed database.

    methods:

    __init__(defaults=None, dict_type=_default_dict, allow_no_value=False,
             delimiters=('=', ':'), comment_prefixes=('#', ';'),
             inline_comment_prefixes=None, strict=True,
             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>):
        Create the parser. When `defaults' is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type' is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters' is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values' is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value' is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section' is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser objects don't do
        any sort of interpolation, whereas ConfigParser uses an instance of
        BasicInterpolation. The library also provides a ``zc.buildbot``
        inspired ExtendedInterpolation implementation.

        When `converters` is given, it should be a dictionary where each key
        represents the name of a type converter and each value is a callable
        implementing the conversion from string to the desired datatype. Every
        converter gets its corresponding get*() method on the parser object and
        section proxies.

    sections()
        Return all the configuration section names, sans DEFAULT.

    has_section(section)
        Return whether the given section exists.

    has_option(section, option)
        Return whether the given option exists in the given section.

    options(section)
        Return list of configuration options for the named section.

    read(filenames, encoding=None)
        Read and parse the iterable of named configuration files, given by
        name.  A single filename is also allowed.  Non-existing files
        are ignored.  Return list of successfully read files.

    read_file(f, filename=None)
        Read and parse one configuration file, given as a file object.
        The filename defaults to f.name; it is only used in error
        messages (if f has no `name' attribute, the string `<???>' is used).

    read_string(string)
        Read configuration from a given string.

    read_dict(dictionary)
        Read configuration from a dictionary. Keys are section names,
        values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present
        in the section. If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections
        and their keys will be added in order. Values are automatically
        converted to strings.

    get(section, option, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Return a string value for the named option.  All % interpolations are
        expanded in the return values, based on the defaults passed into the
        constructor and the DEFAULT section.  Additional substitutions may be
        provided using the `vars' argument, which must be a dictionary whose
        contents override any pre-existing defaults. If `option' is a key in
        `vars', the value from `vars' is used.

    getint(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to an integer.

    getfloat(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a float.

    getboolean(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a boolean (currently case
        insensitively defined as 0, false, no, off for False, and 1, true,
        yes, on for True).  Returns False or True.

    items(section=_UNSET, raw=False, vars=None)
        If section is given, return a list of tuples with (name, value) for
        each option in the section. Otherwise, return a list of tuples with
        (section_name, section_proxy) for each section, including DEFAULTSECT.

    remove_section(section)
        Remove the given file section and all its options.

    remove_option(section, option)
        Remove the given option from the given section.

    set(section, option, value)
        Set the given option.

    write(fp, space_around_delimiters=True)
        Write the configuration state in .ini format. If
        `space_around_delimiters' is True (the default), delimiters
        between keys and values are surrounded by spaces.

A configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations and such in
the style of RFC 822.

Intrinsic defaults can be specified by passing them into the
ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary.

class:

ConfigParser -- responsible for parsing a list of
                    configuration files, and managing the parsed database.

    methods:

    __init__(defaults=None, dict_type=_default_dict, allow_no_value=False,

             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>):
        Create the parser. When `defaults' is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type' is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters' is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values' is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value' is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section' is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser objects don't do
        any sort of interpolation, whereas ConfigParser uses an instance of
        BasicInterpolation. The library also provides a ``zc.buildbot``
        inspired ExtendedInterpolation implementation.

        When `converters` is given, it should be a dictionary where each key
        represents the name of a type converter and each value is a callable
        implementing the conversion from string to the desired datatype. Every
        converter gets its corresponding get*() method on the parser object and
        section proxies.

    sections()
        Return all the configuration section names, sans DEFAULT.

    has_section(section)
        Return whether the given section exists.

    has_option(section, option)
        Return whether the given option exists in the given section.

    options(section)
        Return list of configuration options for the named section.

    read(filenames, encoding=None)
        Read and parse the iterable of named configuration files, given by
        name.  A single filename is also allowed.  Non-existing files
        are ignored.  Return list of successfully read files.

    read_file(f, filename=None)
        Read and parse one configuration file, given as a file object.
        The filename defaults to f.name; it is only used in error
        messages (if f has no `name' attribute, the string `<???>' is used).

    read_string(string)
        Read configuration from a given string.

    read_dict(dictionary)
        Read configuration from a dictionary. Keys are section names,
        values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present
        in the section. If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections
        and their keys will be added in order. Values are automatically
        converted to strings.

    get(section, option, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Return a string value for the named option.  All % interpolations are
        expanded in the return values, based on the defaults passed into the
        constructor and the DEFAULT section.  Additional substitutions may be
        provided using the `vars' argument, which must be a dictionary whose
        contents override any pre-existing defaults. If `option' is a key in
        `vars', the value from `vars' is used.

    getint(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to an integer.

    getfloat(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a float.

    getboolean(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a boolean (currently case
        insensitively defined as 0, false, no, off for False, and 1, true,
        yes, on for True).  Returns False or True.

    items(section=_UNSET, raw=False, vars=None)
        If section is given, return a list of tuples with (name, value) for
        each option in the section. Otherwise, return a list of tuples with
        (section_name, section_proxy) for each section, including DEFAULTSECT.

    remove_section(section)
        Remove the given file section and all its options.

    remove_option(section, option)
        Remove the given option from the given section.

    set(section, option, value)
        Set the given option.

    write(fp, space_around_delimiters=True)
        Write the configuration state in .ini format. If
        `space_around_delimiters' is True (the default), delimiters
        between keys and values are surrounded by spaces.

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist
with shallow copy operations:

 a) recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,
    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop

 b) because deep copy copies *everything* it may copy too much, e.g.
    administrative data structures that should be shared even between
    copies

Python's deep copy operation avoids these problems by:

 a) keeping a table of objects already copied during the current
    copying pass

 b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the
    set of components copied

This version does not copy types like module, class, function, method,
nor stack trace, stack frame, nor file, socket, window, nor array, nor
any similar types.

Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use
to control pickling: they can define methods called __getinitargs__(),
__getstate__() and __setstate__().  See the documentation for module
"pickle" for information on these methods.

                               does not affect manually set environment
                               variables which are always read.
    :param default_map: a dictionary (like object) with default values
                        for parameters.
    :param terminal_width: the width of the terminal.  The default is
                           inherit from parent context.  If no context
                           defines the terminal width then auto
                           detection will be applied.
    :param max_content_width: the maximum width for content rendered by
                              Click (this currently only affects help
                              pages).  This defaults to 80 characters if
                              not overridden.  In other words: even if the
                              terminal is larger than that, Click will not
                              format things wider than 80 characters by
                              default.  In addition to that, formatters might
                              add some safety mapping on the right.
    :param resilient_parsing: if this flag is enabled then Click will
                              parse without any interactivity or callback
                              invocation.  Default values will also be
                              ignored.  This is useful for implementing
                              things such as completion support.
    :param allow_extra_args: if this is set to `True` then extra arguments
                             at the end will not raise an error and will be
                             kept on the context.  The default is to inherit
                             from the command.
    :param allow_interspersed_args: if this is set to `False` then options
                                    and arguments cannot be mixed.  The
                                    default is to inherit from the command.
    :param ignore_unknown_options: instructs click to ignore options it does
                                   not know and keeps them for later
                                   processing.
    :param help_option_names: optionally a list of strings that define how
                              the default help parameter is named.  The
                              default is ``['--help']``.
    :param token_normalize_func: an optional function that is used to
                                 normalize tokens (options, choices,
                                 etc.).  This for instance can be used to
                                 implement case insensitive behavior.
    :param color: controls if the terminal supports ANSI colors or not.  The
                  default is autodetection.  This is only needed if ANSI
                  codes are used in texts that Click prints which is by
                  default not the case.  This for instance would affect
                  help output.
    :param show_default: Show the default value for commands. If this
        value is not set, it defaults to the value from the parent
        context. ``Command.show_default`` overrides this default for the
        specific command.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.1
        The ``show_default`` parameter is overridden by
        ``Command.show_default``, instead of the other way around.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0
        The ``show_default`` parameter defaults to the value from the
        parent context.

    .. versionchanged:: 7.1
       Added the ``show_default`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.0
        Added the ``color``, ``ignore_unknown_options``, and

                info = ctx.to_info_dict()

        .. versionadded:: 8.0
        scopeThis helper method can be used with the context object to promote
        it to the current thread local (see :func:`get_current_context`).
        The default behavior of this is to invoke the cleanup functions which
        can be disabled by setting `cleanup` to `False`.  The cleanup
        functions are typically used for things such as closing file handles.

        If the cleanup is intended the context object can also be directly
        used as a context manager.

        Example usage::

            with ctx.scope():
                assert get_current_context() is ctx

        This is equivalent::

            with ctx:
                assert get_current_context() is ctx

        .. versionadded:: 5.0

        :param cleanup: controls if the cleanup functions should be run or
                        not.  The default is to run these functions.  In
                        some situations the context only wants to be
                        temporarily pushed in which case this can be disabled.
                        Nested pushes automatically defer the cleanup.
        This is a dictionary which is shared with all the contexts
        that are nested.  It exists so that click utilities can store some
        state here if they need to.  It is however the responsibility of
        that code to manage this dictionary well.

        The keys are supposed to be unique dotted strings.  For instance
        module paths are a good choice for it.  What is stored in there is
        irrelevant for the operation of click.  However what is important is
        that code that places data here adheres to the general semantics of
        the system.

        Example usage::

            LANG_KEY = f'{__name__}.lang'

            def set_language(value):
                ctx = get_current_context()
                ctx.meta[LANG_KEY] = value

            def get_language():
                return get_current_context().meta.get(LANG_KEY, 'en_US')

        make_formatterCreates the :class:`~click.HelpFormatter` for the help and
        usage output.

        To quickly customize the formatter class used without overriding
        this method, set the :attr:`formatter_class` attribute.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            Added the :attr:`formatter_class` attribute.
        context_managerRegister a resource as if it were used in a ``with``
        statement. The resource will be cleaned up when the context is
        popped.

        Uses :meth:`contextlib.ExitStack.enter_context`. It calls the
        resource's ``__enter__()`` method and returns the result. When
        the context is popped, it closes the stack, which calls the
        resource's ``__exit__()`` method.

        To register a cleanup function for something that isn't a
        context manager, use :meth:`call_on_close`. Or use something
        from :mod:`contextlib` to turn it into a context manager first.

        .. code-block:: python

            @click.group()
            @click.option("--name")
            @click.pass_context
            def cli(ctx):
                ctx.obj = ctx.with_resource(connect_db(name))

        :param context_manager: The context manager to enter.
        :return: Whatever ``context_manager.__enter__()`` returns.

        .. versionadded:: 8.0
        call_on_closeRegister a function to be called when the context tears down.

        This can be used to close resources opened during the script
        execution. Resources that support Python's context manager
        protocol which would be used in a ``with`` statement should be
        registered with :meth:`with_resource` instead.

        :param f: The function to execute on teardown.
        Invoke all close callbacks registered with
        :meth:`call_on_close`, and exit all context managers entered
        with :meth:`with_resource`.
        command_pathThe computed command path.  This is used for the ``usage``
        information on the help page.  It's automatically created by
        combining the info names of the chain of contexts to the root.
        parent_command_pathget_paramsget_usage_piecesfind_rootFinds the outermost context.find_objectobject_typeFinds the closest object of a given type.Like :meth:`find_object` but sets the innermost object to a
        new instance of `object_type` if it does not exist.
        lookup_defaultte.Literal[True]te.Literal[False]Get the default for a parameter from :attr:`default_map`.

        :param name: Name of the parameter.
        :param call: If the default is a callable, call it. Disable to
            return the callable instead.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            Added the ``call`` parameter.

        Aborts the script.Exits the application with a given exit code.get_usageHelper method to get formatted usage string for the current
        context and command.
        get_helpHelper method to get formatted help page for the current

        _make_sub_contextCreate a new context of the same type as this context, but
        for a new command.

        :meta private:
        t.Callable[..., V]__selfInvokes a command callback in exactly the way it expects.  There
        are two ways to invoke this method:

        1.  the first argument can be a callback and all other arguments and
            keyword arguments are forwarded directly to the function.
        2.  the first argument is a click command object.  In that case all
            arguments are forwarded as well but proper click parameters
            (options and click arguments) must be keyword arguments and Click
            will fill in defaults.

        Note that before Click 3.2 keyword arguments were not properly filled
        in against the intention of this code and no context was created.  For
        more information about this change and why it was done in a bugfix
        release see :ref:`upgrade-to-3.2`.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            All ``kwargs`` are tracked in :attr:`params` so they will be
            passed if :meth:`forward` is called at multiple levels.
        other_cmdThe given command does not have a callback that can be invoked.type_cast_valueforward__cmdSimilar to :meth:`invoke` but fills in default keyword
        arguments from the current context if the other command expects
        it.  This cannot invoke callbacks directly, only other commands.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            All ``kwargs`` are tracked in :attr:`params` so they will be
            passed if ``forward`` is called at multiple levels.
        Callback is not a command.set_parameter_sourceSet the source of a parameter. This indicates the location
        from which the value of the parameter was obtained.

        :param name: The name of the parameter.
        :param source: A member of :class:`~click.core.ParameterSource`.
        Get the source of a parameter. This indicates the location
        from which the value of the parameter was obtained.

        This can be useful for determining when a user specified a value
        on the command line that is the same as the default value. It
        will be :attr:`~click.core.ParameterSource.DEFAULT` only if the
        value was actually taken from the default.

        :param name: The name of the parameter.
        :rtype: ParameterSource

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            Returns ``None`` if the parameter was not provided from any
            source.
        The base command implements the minimal API contract of commands.
    Most code will never use this as it does not implement a lot of useful
    functionality but it can act as the direct subclass of alternative
    parsing methods that do not depend on the Click parser.

    For instance, this can be used to bridge Click and other systems like
    argparse or docopt.

    Because base commands do not implement a lot of the API that other
    parts of Click take for granted, they are not supported for all
    operations.  For instance, they cannot be used with the decorators
    usually and they have no built-in callback system.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
       Added the `context_settings` parameter.

    :param name: the name of the command to use unless a group overrides it.
    :param context_settings: an optional dictionary with defaults that are
                             passed to the context object.
    context_classGather information that could be useful for a tool generating
        user-facing documentation. This traverses the entire structure
        below this command.

        Use :meth:`click.Context.to_info_dict` to traverse the entire
        CLI structure.

        :param ctx: A :class:`Context` representing this command.

        .. versionadded:: 8.0
        Base commands cannot get usageBase commands cannot get helpThis function when given an info name and arguments will kick
        off the parsing and create a new :class:`Context`.  It does not
        invoke the actual command callback though.

        To quickly customize the context class used without overriding
        this method, set the :attr:`context_class` attribute.

        :param info_name: the info name for this invocation.  Generally this
                          is the most descriptive name for the script or
                          command.  For the toplevel script it's usually
                          the name of the script, for commands below it's
                          the name of the command.
        :param args: the arguments to parse as list of strings.
        :param parent: the parent context if available.
        :param extra: extra keyword arguments forwarded to the context
                      constructor.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0
            Added the :attr:`context_class` attribute.
        Given a context and a list of arguments this creates the parser
        and parses the arguments, then modifies the context as necessary.
        This is automatically invoked by :meth:`make_context`.
        Base commands do not know how to parse arguments.Given a context, this invokes the command.  The default
        implementation is raising a not implemented error.
        Base commands are not invocable by defaultshell_completeReturn a list of completions for the incomplete value. Looks
        at the names of chained multi-commands.

        Any command could be part of a chained multi-command, so sibling
        commands are valid at any point during command completion. Other
        command classes will return more completions.

        :param ctx: Invocation context for this command.
        :param incomplete: Value being completed. May be empty.

        .. versionadded:: 8.0
        click.shell_completionget_short_help_strprog_namecomplete_varstandalone_modewindows_expand_argsThis is the way to invoke a script with all the bells and
        whistles as a command line application.  This will always terminate
        the application after a call.  If this is not wanted, ``SystemExit``
        needs to be caught.

        This method is also available by directly calling the instance of
        a :class:`Command`.

        :param args: the arguments that should be used for parsing.  If not
                     provided, ``sys.argv[1:]`` is used.
        :param prog_name: the program name that should be used.  By default
                          the program name is constructed by taking the file
                          name from ``sys.argv[0]``.
        :param complete_var: the environment variable that controls the
                             bash completion support.  The default is
                             ``"_<prog_name>_COMPLETE"`` with prog_name in
                             uppercase.
        :param standalone_mode: the default behavior is to invoke the script
                                in standalone mode.  Click will then
                                handle exceptions and convert them into
                                error messages and the function will never
                                return but shut down the interpreter.  If
                                this is set to `False` they will be
                                propagated to the caller and the return
                                value of this function is the return value
                                of :meth:`invoke`.
        :param windows_expand_args: Expand glob patterns, user dir, and
            env vars in command line args on Windows.
        :param extra: extra keyword arguments are forwarded to the context
                      constructor.  See :class:`Context` for more information.

        .. versionchanged:: 8.0.1

    :param epilog: like the help string but it's printed at the end of the
                   help page after everything else.
    :param short_help: the short help to use for this command.  This is
                       shown on the command listing of the parent command.
    :param add_help_option: by default each command registers a ``--help``
                            option.  This can be disabled by this parameter.
    :param no_args_is_help: this controls what happens if no arguments are
                            provided.  This option is disabled by default.
                            If enabled this will add ``--help`` as argument
                            if no arguments are passed
    :param hidden: hide this command from help outputs.

    :param deprecated: issues a message indicating that

        A multi command is the basic implementation of a command that
    dispatches to subcommands.  The most common version is the
    :class:`Group`.

    :param invoke_without_command: this controls how the multi command itself
                                   is invoked.  By default it's only invoked
                                   if a subcommand is provided.
    :param no_args_is_help: this controls what happens if no arguments are
                            provided.  This option is enabled by default if
                            `invoke_without_command` is disabled or disabled
                            if it's enabled.  If enabled this will add
                            ``--help`` as argument if no arguments are
                            passed.
    :param subcommand_metavar: the string that is used in the documentation
                               to indicate the subcommand place.
    :param chain: if this is set to `True` chaining of multiple subcommands
                  is enabled.  This restricts the form of commands in that
                  they cannot have optional arguments but it allows
                  multiple commands to be chained together.
    :param result_callback: The result callback to attach to this multi
        command. This can be set or changed later with the
        :meth:`result_callback` decorator.
    :param attrs: Other command arguments described in :class:`Command`.

By default if a
        result callback is already registered this will chain them but
        this can be disabled with the `replace` parameter.  The result
        callback is invoked with the return value of the subcommand
        (or the list of return values from all subcommands if chaining
        is enabled) as well as the parameters as they would be passed
        to the main callback.

        Example::

            @click.group()
            @click.option('-i', '--input', default=23)
            def cli(input):

        A group allows a command to have subcommands attached. This is
    the most common way to implement nesting in Click.

    :param name: The name of the group command.
    :param commands: A dict mapping names to :class:`Command` objects.
        Can also be a list of :class:`Command`, which will use
        :attr:`Command.name` to create the dict.
    :param attrs: Other command arguments described in

            Added the :attr:`group_class` attribute.
        Use 'group(**kwargs)(callable)' to provide arguments.A command collection is a multi command that merges multiple multi
    commands together into one.  This is a straightforward implementation
    that accepts a list of different multi commands as sources and
    provides all the commands for each of them.

    See :class:`MultiCommand` and :class:`Command` for the description of
    ``name`` and ``attrs``.
    add_sourcemulti_cmdAdds a new multi command to the chain dispatcher._check_iterCheck if the value is iterable but not a string. Raises a type
    error, or return an iterator over the value.
    A parameter to a command comes in two versions: they are either
    :class:`Option`\s or :class:`Argument`\s.  Other subclasses are currently
    not supported by design as some of the internals for parsing are
    intentionally not finalized.

    Some settings are supported by both options and arguments.

    :param param_decls: the parameter declarations for this option or
                        argument.  This is a list of flags or argument
                        names.
    :param type: the type that should be used.  Either a :class:`ParamType`
                 or a Python type.  The latter is converted into the former
                 automatically if supported.
    :param required: controls if this is optional or not.
    :param default: the default value if omitted.  This can also be a callable,
                    in which case it's invoked when the default is needed
                    without any arguments.
    :param callback: A function to further process or validate the value
        after type conversion. It is called as ``f(ctx, param, value)``
        and must return the value. It is called for all sources,
        including prompts.
    :param nargs: the number of arguments to match.  If not ``1`` the return
                  value is a tuple instead of single value.  The default for
                  nargs is ``1`` (except if the type is a tuple, then it's
                  the arity of the tuple). If ``nargs=-1``, all remaining
                  parameters are collected.
    :param metavar: how the value is represented in the help page.
    :param expose_value: if this is `True` then the value is passed onwards
                         to the command callback and stored on the context,
                         otherwise it's skipped.
    :param is_eager: eager values are processed before non eager ones.  This
                     should not be set for arguments or it will inverse the
                     order of processing.
    :param envvar: a string or list of strings that are environment variables
                   that should be checked.
    :param shell_complete: A function that returns custom shell
        completions. Used instead of the param's type completion if
        given. Takes ``ctx, param, incomplete`` and must return a list
        of :class:`~click.shell_completion.CompletionItem` or a list of
        strings.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0
        ``process_value`` validates required parameters and bounded
        ``nargs``, and invokes the parameter callback before returning
        the value. This allows the callback to validate prompts.
        ``full_process_value`` is removed.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0
        ``autocompletion`` is renamed to ``shell_complete`` and has new
        semantics described above. The old name is deprecated and will
        be removed in 8.1, until then it will be wrapped to match the
        new requirements.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0
        For ``multiple=True, nargs>1``, the default must be a list of
        tuples.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0
        Setting a default is no longer required for ``nargs>1``, it will
        default to ``None``. ``multiple=True`` or ``nargs=-1`` will
        default to ``()``.

    .. versionchanged:: 7.1
        Empty environment variables are ignored rather than taking the
        empty string value. This makes it possible for scripts to clear
        variables if they can't unset them.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
        Changed signature for parameter callback to also be passed the
        parameter. The old callback format will still work, but it will
        raise a warning to give you a chance to migrate the code easier.

        .. versionadded:: 8.0
        Options are usually optional values on the command line and
    have some extra features that arguments don't have.

    All other parameters are passed onwards to the parameter constructor.

    :param show_default: Show the default value for this option in its
        help text. Values are not shown by default, unless
        :attr:`Context.show_default` is ``True``. If this value is a
        string, it shows that string in parentheses instead of the
        actual value. This is particularly useful for dynamic options.
        For single option boolean flags, the default remains hidden if
        its value is ``False``.
    :param show_envvar: Controls if an environment variable should be
        shown on the help page. Normally, environment variables are not
        shown.
    :param prompt: If set to ``True`` or a non empty string then the
        user will be prompted for input. If set to ``True`` the prompt
        will be the option name capitalized.
    :param confirmation_prompt: Prompt a second time to confirm the
        value if it was prompted for. Can be set to a string instead of
        ``True`` to customize the message.
    :param prompt_required: If set to ``False``, the user will be
        prompted for input only when the option was specified as a flag
        without a value.
    :param hide_input: If this is ``True`` then the input on the prompt
        will be hidden from the user. This is useful for password input.
    :param is_flag: forces this option to act as a flag.  The default is
                    auto detection.
    :param flag_value: which value should be used for this flag if it's
                       enabled.  This is set to a boolean automatically if
                       the option string contains a slash to mark two options.
    :param multiple: if this is set to `True` then the argument is accepted
                     multiple times and recorded.  This is similar to ``nargs``
                     in how it works but supports arbitrary number of
                     arguments.
    :param count: this flag makes an option increment an integer.
    :param allow_from_autoenv: if this is enabled then the value of this
                               parameter will be pulled from an environment
                               variable in case a prefix is defined on the
                               context.
    :param help: the help string.
    :param hidden: hide this option from help outputs.
    :param attrs: Other command arguments described in :class:`Parameter`.

    The context is useful as it can pass internal objects around and can
    control special execution features such as reading data from
    environment variables.

    A context can be used as context manager in which case it will call
    :meth:`close` on teardown.

                               from environment variables is disabled.  This
                               does not affect manually set environment
                               variables which are always read.
    :param default_map: a dictionary (like object) with default values
                        for parameters.

                           inherit from parent context.  If no context
                           defines the terminal width then auto

                              pages).  This defaults to 80 characters if
                              not overridden.  In other words: even if the
                              terminal is larger than that, Click will not
                              format things wider than 80 characters by

                              ignored.  This is useful for implementing
                              things such as completion support.
    :param allow_extra_args: if this is set to `True` then extra arguments

                                    and arguments cannot be mixed.  The
                                    default is to inherit from the command.

                                 implement case insensitive behavior.
    :param color: controls if the terminal supports ANSI colors or not.  The
                  default is autodetection.  This is only needed if ANSI

    :class:`Option`\s or :class:`Argument`\s.  Other subclasses are currently
    not supported by design as some of the internals for parsing are
    intentionally not finalized.

    Some settings are supported by both options and arguments.

    :param param_decls: the parameter declarations for this option or
                        argument.  This is a list of flags or argument
                        names.
    :param type: the type that should be used.  Either a :class:`ParamType`
                 or a Python type.  The latter is converted into the former
                 automatically if supported.
    :param required: controls if this is optional or not.
    :param default: the default value if omitted.  This can also be a callable,
                    in which case it's invoked when the default is needed
                    without any arguments.
    :param callback: A function to further process or validate the value
        after type conversion. It is called as ``f(ctx, param, value)``
        and must return the value. It is called for all sources,
        including prompts.
    :param nargs: the number of arguments to match.  If not ``1`` the return
                  value is a tuple instead of single value.  The default for
                  nargs is ``1`` (except if the type is a tuple, then it's
                  the arity of the tuple). If ``nargs=-1``, all remaining
                  parameters are collected.
    :param metavar: how the value is represented in the help page.
    :param expose_value: if this is `True` then the value is passed onwards
                         to the command callback and stored on the context,
                         otherwise it's skipped.

    'u'A parameter to a command comes in two versions: they are either
    :class:`Option`\s or :class:`Argument`\s.  Other subclasses are currently
    not supported by design as some of the internals for parsing are
    intentionally not finalized.

    Some settings are supported by both options and arguments.

    :param param_decls: the parameter declarations for this option or
                        argument.  This is a list of flags or argument
                        names.
    :param type: the type that should be used.  Either a :class:`ParamType`
                 or a Python type.  The latter is converted into the former
                 automatically if supported.
    :param required: controls if this is optional or not.
    :param default: the default value if omitted.  This can also be a callable,
                    in which case it's invoked when the default is needed
                    without any arguments.
    :param callback: A function to further process or validate the value
        after type conversion. It is called as ``f(ctx, param, value)``
        and must return the value. It is called for all sources,
        including prompts.
    :param nargs: the number of arguments to match.  If not ``1`` the return
                  value is a tuple instead of single value.  The default for
                  nargs is ``1`` (except if the type is a tuple, then it's
                  the arity of the tuple). If ``nargs=-1``, all remaining
                  parameters are collected.
    :param metavar: how the value is represented in the help page.
    :param expose_value: if this is `True` then the value is passed onwards
                         to the command callback and stored on the context,
                         otherwise it's skipped.
    :param is_eager: eager values are processed before non eager ones.  This
                     should not be set for arguments or it will inverse the
                     order of processing.
    :param envvar: a string or list of strings that are environment variables
                   that should be checked.
    :param shell_complete: A function that returns custom shell
        completions. Used instead of the param's type completion if
        given. Takes ``ctx, param, incomplete`` and must return a list

    The app context contains application-specific information. An app
    context is created and pushed at the beginning of each request if
    one is not already active. An app context is also pushed when
    running CLI commands.
    _cv_tokensBinds the app context to the current context.Pops the app context.Popped wrong app context. ( instead of The request context contains per-request information. The Flask
    app creates and pushes it at the beginning of the request, then pops
    it at the end of the request. It will create the URL adapter and
    request object for the WSGI environment provided.

    Do not attempt to use this class directly, instead use
    :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_request_context` and
    :meth:`~flask.Flask.request_context` to create this object.

    When the request context is popped, it will evaluate all the
    functions registered on the application for teardown execution
    (:meth:`~flask.Flask.teardown_request`).

    The request context is automatically popped at the end of the
    request. When using the interactive debugger, the context will be
    restored so ``request`` is still accessible. Similarly, the test
    client can preserve the context after the request ends. However,
    teardown functions may already have closed some resources such as
    database connections.
    json_moduleflashesCreates a copy of this request context with the same request object.
        This can be used to move a request context to a different greenlet.
        Because the actual request object is the same this cannot be used to
        move a request context to a different thread unless access to the

    dataclass instances. This will also look into built-in containers:
    tuples, lists, and dicts.
    asdict() should be called on dataclass instances_asdict_innertuple_factoryReturn the fields of a dataclass instance as a new tuple of field values.

    tuples, lists, and dicts.
    astuple() should be called on dataclass instances_astuple_innercls_nameReturn a new dynamically created dataclass.

    The dataclass name will be 'cls_name'.  'fields' is an iterable
    of either (name), (name, type) or (name, type, Field) objects. If type is
    omitted, use the string 'typing.Any'.  Field objects are created by
    the equivalent of calling 'field(name, type [, Field-info])'.

      C = make_dataclass('C', ['x', ('y', int), ('z', int, field(init=False))], bases=(Base,))

    is equivalent to:

      @dataclass
      class C(Base):
          x: 'typing.Any'
          y: int
          z: int = field(init=False)

    For the bases and namespace parameters, see the builtin type() function.

    The parameters init, repr, eq, order, unsafe_hash, and frozen are passed to
    dataclass().

We can't# fall back to the class dict's value, both because it's# not set, and because it might be different per-class# (which, after all, is why we have a factory function!).# No default factory.# There's no default, just do an assignment.# This field does not need initialization.

However, return None to signify that we're not going# to actually do the assignment statement for InitVars.# Now, actually generate the field assignment.# Return the __init__ parameter string for this field.  For# example, the equivalent of 'x:int=3' (except instead of 'int',# reference a variable set to int, and instead of '3', reference a# variable set to 3).# There's no default, and no default_factory, just output the# variable name and type.# There's a default, this will be the name that's used to look# it up.# There's a factory function.

For example, when checking that annotation denotes a# ClassVar, then a_module is typing, and a_type is# typing.ClassVar.# It's possible to look up a_module given a_type, but it involves# looking in sys.modules (again!), and seems like a waste since# the caller already knows a_module.# - annotation is a string type annotation# - cls is the class that this annotation was found in# - a_module is the module we want to match# - a_type is the type in that module we want to match# - is_type_predicate is a function called with (obj, a_module)#   that determines if obj is of the desired type.# Since this test does not do a local namespace lookup (and# instead only a module (global) lookup), there are some things it# gets wrong.# With string annotations, cv0 will be detected as a ClassVar:#   CV = ClassVar#   @dataclass#   class C0:#     cv0: CV# But in this example cv1 will not be detected as a ClassVar:#   class C1:#     CV = ClassVar#     cv1: CV# In C1, the code in this function (_is_type) will look up "CV" in# the module and not find it, so it will not consider cv1 as a# ClassVar.  This is a fairly obscure corner case, and the best# way to fix it would be to eval() the string "CV" with the# correct global and local namespaces.  However that would involve# a eval() penalty for every single field of every dataclass# that's defined.  It was judged not worth it.# No module name, assume the class's module did# "from dataclasses import InitVar".# Look up module_name in the class's module.# Return a Field object for this field name and type.  ClassVars# and InitVars are also returned, but marked as such (see# f._field_type).# If the default value isn't derived from Field, then it's only a# normal default value.

Set them.# Assume it's a normal field until proven otherwise.  We're next# going to decide if it's a ClassVar or InitVar, everything else# is just a normal field.# In addition to checking for actual types here, also check for# string annotations.  get_type_hints() won't always work for us# (see https://github.com/python/typing/issues/508 for example),# plus it's expensive and would require an eval for every string# annotation.  So, make a best effort to see if this is a ClassVar# or InitVar using regex's and checking that the thing referenced# is actually of the correct type.# For the complete discussion, see https://bugs.python.org/issue33453# If typing has not been imported, then it's impossible for any# annotation to be a ClassVar.

    When the ratio is exactly half-way between two integers,
    the even integer is returned.
    greater_than_halfRepresent the difference between two datetime objects.

    Supported operators:

    - add, subtract timedelta
    - unary plus, minus, abs
    - compare to timedelta
    - multiply, divide by int

    In addition, datetime supports subtraction of two datetime objects
    returning a timedelta, and addition or subtraction of a datetime
    and a timedelta giving a datetime.

    Representation: (days, seconds, microseconds).  Why?  Because I
    felt like it.

The insecurity here is# at the start of daylight time.  Picture US Eastern for concreteness.  The wall# time jumps from 1:59 to 3:00, and wall hours of the form 2:MM don't make good# sense then.  The docs ask that an Eastern tzinfo class consider such a time to# be EDT (because it's "after 2"), which is a redundant spelling of 1:MM EST# on the day DST starts.  We want to return the 1:MM EST spelling because that's# the only spelling that makes sense on the local wall clock.# In fact, if [5] holds at this point, we do have the standard-time spelling,# but that takes a bit of proof.  We first prove a stronger result.  What's the# difference between the LHS and RHS of [5]?  Let#     diff = x.n - (z.n - z.o)                    [6]# Now#     z.n =                       by [4]#     (y + y.s).n =               by #5#     y.n + y.s =                 since y.n = x.n#     x.n + y.s =                 since z and y are have the same tzinfo member,#                                     y.s = z.s by #2#     x.n + z.s# Plugging that back into [6] gives#     diff =#     x.n - ((x.n + z.s) - z.o) =     expanding#     x.n - x.n - z.s + z.o =         cancelling#     - z.s + z.o =                   by #2#     z.d# So diff = z.d.# If [5] is true now, diff = 0, so z.d = 0 too, and we have the standard-time# spelling we wanted in the endcase described above.  We're done.  Contrarily,# if z.d = 0, then we have a UTC equivalent, and are also done.# If [5] is not true now, diff = z.d != 0, and z.d is the offset we need to# add to z (in effect, z is in tz's standard time, and we need to shift the# local clock into tz's daylight time).# Let#     z' = z + z.d = z + diff                     [7]# and we can again ask whether#     z'.n - z'.o = x.n                           [8]# If so, we're done.  If not, the tzinfo class is insane, according to the# assumptions we've made.  This also requires a bit of proof.  As before, let's# compute the difference between the LHS and RHS of [8] (and skipping some of# the justifications for the kinds of substitutions we've done several times# already):#     diff' = x.n - (z'.n - z'.o) =           replacing z'.n via [7]#             x.n  - (z.n + diff - z'.o) =    replacing diff via [6]#             x.n - (z.n + x.n - (z.n - z.o) - z'.o) =#             x.n - z.n - x.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =    cancel x.n#             - z.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =              cancel z.n#             - z.o + z'.o =                      #1 twice#             -z.s - z.d + z'.s + z'.d =          z and z' have same tzinfo#             z'.d - z.d# So z' is UTC-equivalent to x iff z'.d = z.d at this point.  If they are equal,# we've found the UTC-equivalent so are done.  In fact, we stop with [7] and# return z', not bothering to compute z'.d.# How could z.d and z'd differ?  z' = z + z.d [7], so merely moving z' by# a dst() offset, and starting *from* a time already in DST (we know z.d != 0),# would have to change the result dst() returns:  we start in DST, and moving# a little further into it takes us out of DST.# There isn't a sane case where this can happen.  The closest it gets is at# the end of DST, where there's an hour in UTC with no spelling in a hybrid# tzinfo class.  In US Eastern, that's 5:MM UTC = 0:MM EST = 1:MM EDT.  During# that hour, on an Eastern clock 1:MM is taken as being in standard time (6:MM# UTC) because the docs insist on that, but 0:MM is taken as being in daylight# time (4:MM UTC).  There is no local time mapping to 5:MM UTC.  The local# clock jumps from 1:59 back to 1:00 again, and repeats the 1:MM hour in# standard time.  Since that's what the local clock *does*, we want to map both# UTC hours 5:MM and 6:MM to 1:MM Eastern.  The result is ambiguous# in local time, but so it goes -- it's the way the local clock works.# When x = 5:MM UTC is the input to this algorithm, x.o=0, y.o=-5 and y.d=0,# so z=0:MM.  z.d=60 (minutes) then, so [5] doesn't hold and we keep going.# z' = z + z.d = 1:MM then, and z'.d=0, and z'.d - z.d = -60 != 0 so [8]# (correctly) concludes that z' is not UTC-equivalent to x.# Because we know z.d said z was in daylight time (else [5] would have held and# we would have stopped then), and we know z.d != z'.d (else [8] would have held# and we have stopped then), and there are only 2 possible values dst() can# return in Eastern, it follows that z'.d must be 0 (which it is in the example,# but the reasoning doesn't depend on the example -- it depends on there being# two possible dst() outcomes, one zero and the other non-zero).  Therefore# z' must be in standard time, and is the spelling we want in this case.# Note again that z' is not UTC-equivalent as far as the hybrid tzinfo class is# concerned (because it takes z' as being in standard time rather than the# daylight time we intend here), but returning it gives the real-life "local# clock repeats an hour" behavior when mapping the "unspellable" UTC hour into# tz.# When the input is 6:MM, z=1:MM and z.d=0, and we stop at once, again with# the 1:MM standard time spelling we want.# So how can this break?  One of the assumptions must be violated.  Two# possibilities:# 1) [2] effectively says that y.s is invariant across all y belong to a given#    time zone.  This isn't true if, for political reasons or continental drift,#    a region decides to change its base offset from UTC.# 2) There may be versions of "double daylight" time where the tail end of#    the analysis gives up a step too early.  I haven't thought about that#    enough to say.# In any case, it's clear that the default fromutc() is strong enough to handle# "almost all" time zones:  so long as the standard offset is invariant, it# doesn't matter if daylight time transition points change from year to year, or# if daylight time is skipped in some years; it doesn't matter how large or# small dst() may get within its bounds; and it doesn't even matter if some# perverse time zone returns a negative dst()).  So a breaking case must be# pretty bizarre, and a tzinfo subclass can override fromutc() if it is.# Clean up unused names# XXX Since import * above excludes names that start with _,# docstring does not get overwritten.

    t.Callable[te.Concatenate[T, P], R]Given an object type this creates a decorator that will work
    similar to :func:`pass_obj` but instead of passing the object of the

    :func:`object_type`.

    This generates a decorator that works roughly like this::

    The name of the command defaults to the name of the function with
    underscores replaced by dashes.  If you want to change that, you can
    pass the intended name as the first argument.

    All keyword arguments are forwarded to the underlying command class.
    For the ``params`` argument, any decorated params are appended to
    the end of the list.

    Once decorated the function turns into a :class:`Command` instance
    that can be invoked as a command line utility or be attached to a
    command :class:`Group`.

    _param_memoAttaches an argument to the command.  All positional arguments are
    passed as parameter declarations to :class:`Argument`; all keyword
    arguments are forwarded unchanged (except ``cls``).
    This is equivalent to creating an :class:`Argument` instance manually
    and attaching it to the :attr:`Command.params` list.

    For the default argument class, refer to :class:`Argument` and

    This is equivalent to creating an :class:`Option` instance manually
    and attaching it to the :attr:`Command.params` list.

    For the default option class, refer to :class:`Option` and
    :class:`Parameter` for descriptions of parameters.

    :param cls: the option class to instantiate.  This defaults to
                :class:`Option`.
    :param param_decls: Passed as positional arguments to the constructor of
        ``cls``.
    :param attrs: Passed as keyword arguments to the constructor of ``cls``.
    Add a ``--yes`` option which shows a prompt before continuing if
    not passed. If the prompt is declined, the program will exit.

    :param param_decls: One or more option names. Defaults to the single

    :param kwargs: Extra arguments are passed to :func:`option`.
    --yesDo you want to continue?Confirm the action without prompting.Add a ``--password`` option which prompts for a password, hiding

    :param kwargs: Extra arguments are passed to :func:`option`.
    --passwordpackage_nameAdd a ``--version`` option which immediately prints the version
    number and exits the program.

    If ``version`` is not provided, Click will try to detect it using
    :func:`importlib.metadata.version` to get the version for the
    ``package_name``. On Python < 3.8, the ``importlib_metadata``
    backport must be installed.

    If ``package_name`` is not provided, Click will try to detect it by
    inspecting the stack frames. This will be used to detect the
    version, so it must match the name of the installed package.

    :param version: The version number to show. If not provided, Click
        will try to detect it.
    :param param_decls: One or more option names. Defaults to the single
        value ``"--version"``.
    :param package_name: The package name to detect the version from. If
        not provided, Click will try to detect it.
    :param prog_name: The name of the CLI to show in the message. If not
        provided, it will be detected from the command.
    :param message: The message to show. The values ``%(prog)s``,
        ``%(package)s``, and ``%(version)s`` are available. Defaults to
        ``"%(prog)s, version %(version)s"``.
    :param kwargs: Extra arguments are passed to :func:`option`.
    :raise RuntimeError: ``version`` could not be detected.

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Methods:

    __init__(isjunk=None, a='', b='')
        Construct a SequenceMatcher.

    set_seqs(a, b)
        Set the two sequences to be compared.

    set_seq1(a)
        Set the first sequence to be compared.

    set_seq2(b)
        Set the second sequence to be compared.

    find_longest_match(alo=0, ahi=None, blo=0, bhi=None)
        Find longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

    get_matching_blocks()
        Return list of triples describing matching subsequences.

    get_opcodes()
        Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

    ratio()
        Return a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

    quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on .ratio() relatively quickly.

    real_quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.
    isjunkautojunkConstruct a SequenceMatcher.

        Optional arg isjunk is None (the default), or a one-argument
        function that takes a sequence element and returns true iff the
        element is junk.  None is equivalent to passing "lambda x: 0", i.e.
        no elements are considered to be junk.  For example, pass
            lambda x: x in " \t"
        if you're comparing lines as sequences of characters, and don't
        want to synch up on blanks or hard tabs.

        Optional arg a is the first of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of a must be hashable.  See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq1().

        Optional arg b is the second of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of b must be hashable. See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq2().

        Optional arg autojunk should be set to False to disable the
        "automatic junk heuristic" that treats popular elements as junk
        (see module documentation for more information).
        set_seqsSet the two sequences to be compared.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher()
        >>> s.set_seqs("abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        set_seq1set_seq2Set the first sequence to be compared.

        The second sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq1("bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        1.0
        >>>

        SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the
        second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against
        many sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x)
        repeatedly for each of the other sequences.

        See also set_seqs() and set_seq2().
        matching_blocksopcodesSet the second sequence to be compared.

        The first sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq2("abcd")
        >>> s.ratio()
        1.0
        >>>

        second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against
        many sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x)
        repeatedly for each of the other sequences.

        fullbcount__chain_bb2jbjunkjunkbpopularpopularntestidxsfind_longest_matchaloahiblobhiFind longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

        By default it will find the longest match in the entirety of a and b.

        If isjunk is not defined:

        Return (i,j,k) such that a[i:i+k] is equal to b[j:j+k], where
            alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi
            blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi
        and for all (i',j',k') meeting those conditions,
            k >= k'
            i <= i'
            and if i == i', j <= j'

        In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that
        starts earliest in a, and of all those maximal matching blocks that
        start earliest in a, return the one that starts earliest in b.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=0, b=4, size=5)

        If isjunk is defined, first the longest matching block is
        determined as above, but with the additional restriction that no
        junk element appears in the block.  Then that block is extended as
        far as possible by matching (only) junk elements on both sides.  So
        the resulting block never matches on junk except as identical junk
        happens to be adjacent to an "interesting" match.

        Here's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be
        junk.  That prevents " abcd" from matching the " abcd" at the tail
        end of the second sequence directly.  Instead only the "abcd" can
        match, and matches the leftmost "abcd" in the second sequence:

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x==" ", " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=1, b=0, size=4)

        If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "ab", "c")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 2, 0, 1)
        Match(a=0, b=0, size=0)
        isbjunkbestibestjbestsizej2lennothingj2lengetnewj2lenget_matching_blocksReturn list of triples describing matching subsequences.

        Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
        a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The triples are monotonically increasing in
        i and in j.  New in Python 2.5, it's also guaranteed that if
        (i, j, n) and (i', j', n') are adjacent triples in the list, and
        the second is not the last triple in the list, then i+n != i' or
        j+n != j'.  IOW, adjacent triples never describe adjacent equal
        blocks.

        The last triple is a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and is the only
        triple with n==0.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abxcd", "abcd")
        >>> list(s.get_matching_blocks())
        [Match(a=0, b=0, size=2), Match(a=3, b=2, size=2), Match(a=5, b=4, size=0)]
        lalbj1k1non_adjacentk2get_opcodesReturn list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

        Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2).  The first tuple
        has i1 == j1 == 0, and remaining tuples have i1 == the i2 from the
        tuple preceding it, and likewise for j1 == the previous j2.

        The tags are strings, with these meanings:

        'replace':  a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2]
        'delete':   a[i1:i2] should be deleted.
                    Note that j1==j2 in this case.
        'insert':   b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1].
                    Note that i1==i2 in this case.
        'equal':    a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2]

        >>> a = "qabxcd"
        >>> b = "abycdf"
        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)

        codesnnratioReturn a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

        Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and
        M is the number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T.
        Note that this is 1 if the sequences are identical, and 0 if
        they have nothing in common.

        .ratio() is expensive to compute if you haven't already computed
        .get_matching_blocks() or .get_opcodes(), in which case you may
        want to try .quick_ratio() or .real_quick_ratio() first to get an
        upper bound.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75

        >>> s.real_quick_ratio()
        1.0
        triplequick_ratioReturn an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
        is faster to compute.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^
    +   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.

    Methods:

    __init__(linejunk=None, charjunk=None)
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

    compare(a, b)
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.
    linejunkcharjunk
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.
        
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writeline()
        method of a file-like object.

        Example:

        >>> print(''.join(Differ().compare('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(True),
        ...                                'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(True))),
        ...       end="")

        ?  -
        + tree
        + emu
        cruncher_fancy_replace_dumpGenerate comparison results for a same-tagged range._plain_replace
        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._fancy_replace(['abcDefghiJkl\n'], 0, 1,
        ...                            ['abcdefGhijkl\n'], 0, 1)
        >>> print(''.join(results), end="")
        - abcDefghiJkl
        ?    ^  ^  ^
        + abcdefGhijkl
        ?    ^  ^  ^
        0.74best_ratioeqieqjbest_ibest_j_fancy_helperaeltbeltatagsbtagsai1ai2bj1bj2_qformatalinebline
        Format "?" output and deal with tabs.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._qformat('\tabcDefghiJkl\n', '\tabcdefGhijkl\n',
        ...                      '  ^ ^  ^      ', '  ^ ^  ^      ')
        >>> for line in results: print(repr(line))
        ...
        '- \tabcDefghiJkl\n'
        '? \t ^ ^  ^\n'
        '+ \tabcdefGhijkl\n'
        '? \t ^ ^  ^\n'
        - ? + \s*(?:#\s*)?$pat
    Return True for ignorable line: iff `line` is blank or contains a single '#'.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('\n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('  #   \n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('hello\n')
    False
    
    Return True for ignorable character: iff `ch` is a space or tab.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK(' ')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\t')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\n')
    False
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('x')
    False
    _format_range_unifiedConvert range to the "ed" formatbeginning{},{}fromfiledatetofiledatelineterm
    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    Example:

    >>> for line in unified_diff('one two three four'.split(),
    ...             'zero one tree four'.split(), 'Original', 'Current',
    ...             '2005-01-26 23:30:50', '2010-04-02 10:20:52',

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a context diff.

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or ---) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The context diff format normally has a header for filenames and
    modification times.  Any or all of these may be specified using
    strings for 'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.
    If not specified, the strings default to blanks.

    Example:

    >>> print(''.join(context_diff('one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True),
    ...       'zero\none\ntree\nfour\n'.splitlines(True), 'Original', 'Current')),

    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    Example:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))

    _mdifffromlinestolinesReturns generator yielding marked up from/to side by side differences.

    Arguments:
    fromlines -- list of text lines to compared to tolines
    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.
    (\++|\-+|\^+)change_rediff_lines_iterator_make_lineformat_keysidenum_linesReturns line of text with user's change markup and line formatting.

        lines -- list of lines from the ndiff generator to produce a line of
                 text from.  When producing the line of text to return, the
                 lines used are removed from this list.
        format_key -- '+' return first line in list with "add" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '-' return first line in list with "delete" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '?' return first line in list with add/delete/change
                          intraline markup (indices obtained from second line)
                      None return first line in list with no markup
        side -- indice into the num_lines list (0=from,1=to)
        num_lines -- from/to current line number.  This is NOT intended to be a
                     passed parameter.  It is present as a keyword argument to
                     maintain memory of the current line numbers between calls
                     of this function.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        sub_inforecord_sub_infomatch_object_line_iteratorYields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from a
        differencing iterator, processes them and yields them.  When it can
        it yields both a "from" and a "to" line, otherwise it will yield one
        or the other.  In addition to yielding the lines of from/to text, a
        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.
        num_blanks_pendingnum_blanks_to_yield-?+?--++--?+--+from_lineto_line-+?-?++--+-_line_pair_iteratorYields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from the line
        iterator.  Its difference from that iterator is that this function
        always yields a pair of from/to text lines (with the change
        indication).  If necessary it will collect single from/to lines
        until it has a matching pair from/to pair to yield.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.

    </table>_legendFor producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.
    _default_prefixwrapcolumnHtmlDiff instance initializer

        Arguments:
        tabsize -- tab stop spacing, defaults to 8.
        wrapcolumn -- column number where lines are broken and wrapped,
            defaults to None where lines are not wrapped.
        linejunk,charjunk -- keyword arguments passed into ndiff() (used by
            HtmlDiff() to generate the side by side HTML differences).  See
            ndiff() documentation for argument default values and descriptions.
        _tabsize_wrapcolumn_linejunk_charjunkfromdesctodescnumlinesReturns HTML file of side by side comparison with change highlights

        Arguments:
        fromlines -- list of "from" lines
        tolines -- list of "to" lines
        fromdesc -- "from" file column header string
        todesc -- "to" file column header string
        context -- set to True for contextual differences (defaults to False
            which shows full differences).
        numlines -- number of context lines.  When context is set True,
            controls number of lines displayed before and after the change.
            When context is False, controls the number of lines to place
            the "next" link anchors before the next change (so click of
            "next" link jumps to just before the change).
        charset -- charset of the HTML document
        styleslegendmake_tabletable_tab_newline_replaceReturns from/to line lists with tabs expanded and newlines removed.

        Instead of tab characters being replaced by the number of spaces
        needed to fill in to the next tab stop, this function will fill
        the space with tab characters.  This is done so that the difference
        algorithms can identify changes in a file when tabs are replaced by
        spaces and vice versa.  At the end of the HTML generation, the tab
        characters will be replaced with a nonbreakable space.
        expand_tabs_split_linedata_listBuilds list of text lines by splitting text lines at wrap point

        This function will determine if the input text line needs to be
        wrapped (split) into separate lines.  If so, the first wrap point
        will be determined and the first line appended to the output
        text line list.  This function is used recursively to handle
        the second part of the split line to further split it.
        line1line2_line_wrapperdiffsReturns iterator that splits (wraps) mdiff text linesfromdatatodatafromlinefromtexttolinetotext_collect_linesCollects mdiff output into separate lists

        Before storing the mdiff from/to data into a list, it is converted
        into a single line of text with HTML markup.
        flaglist_format_linelinenumReturns HTML markup of "from" / "to" text lines

        side -- 0 or 1 indicating "from" or "to" text
        flag -- indicates if difference on line

UNIX(tm) diff does so# strip, so ends up claiming that ab is changed to acab by# inserting "ca" in the middle.  That's minimal but unintuitive:# "it's obvious" that someone inserted "ac" at the front.# Windiff ends up at the same place as diff, but by pairing up# the unique 'b's and then matching the first two 'a's.# find longest junk-free match# during an iteration of the loop, j2len[j] = length of longest# junk-free match ending with a[i-1] and b[j]# look at all instances of a[i] in b; note that because# b2j has no junk keys, the loop is skipped if a[i] is junk# a[i] matches b[j]# Extend the best by non-junk elements on each end.  In particular,# "popular" non-junk elements aren't in b2j, which greatly speeds# the inner loop above, but also means "the best" match so far# doesn't contain any junk *or* popular non-junk elements.# Now that we have a wholly interesting match (albeit possibly# empty!), we may as well suck up the matching junk on each# side of it too.  Can't think of a good reason not to, and it# saves post-processing the (possibly considerable) expense of# figuring out what to do with it.  In the case of an empty# interesting match, this is clearly the right thing to do,# because no other kind of match is possible in the regions.# This is most naturally expressed as a recursive algorithm, but# at least one user bumped into extreme use cases that exceeded# the recursion limit on their box.  So, now we maintain a list# ('queue`) of blocks we still need to look at, and append partial# results to `matching_blocks` in a loop; the matches are sorted# at the end.# a[alo:i] vs b[blo:j] unknown# a[i:i+k] same as b[j:j+k]# a[i+k:ahi] vs b[j+k:bhi] unknown# if k is 0, there was no matching block# It's possible that we have adjacent equal blocks in the# matching_blocks list now.  Starting with 2.5, this code was added# to collapse them.# Is this block adjacent to i1, j1, k1?# Yes, so collapse them -- this just increases the length of# the first block by the length of the second, and the first# block so lengthened remains the block to compare against.# Not adjacent.  Remember the first block (k1==0 means it's# the dummy we started with), and make the second block the# new block to compare against.# invariant:  we've pumped out correct diffs to change# a[:i] into b[:j], and the next matching block is# a[ai:ai+size] == b[bj:bj+size].  So we need to pump# out a diff to change a[i:ai] into b[j:bj], pump out# the matching block, and move (i,j) beyond the match# the list of matching blocks is terminated by a# sentinel with size 0# Fixup leading and trailing groups if they show no changes.# End the current group and start a new one whenever# there is a large range with no changes.# viewing a and b as multisets, set matches to the cardinality# of their intersection; this counts the number of matches# without regard to order, so is clearly an upper bound# avail[x] is the number of times x appears in 'b' less the# number of times we've seen it in 'a' so far ... kinda# can't have more matches than the number of elements in the# shorter sequence# Move the best scorers to head of list# Strip scores for the best n matches# dump the shorter block first -- reduces the burden on short-term# memory if the blocks are of very different sizes# don't synch up unless the lines have a similarity score of at# least cutoff; best_ratio tracks the best score seen so far# 1st indices of equal lines (if any)# search for the pair that matches best without being identical# (identical lines must be junk lines, & we don't want to synch up# on junk -- unless we have to)# computing similarity is expensive, so use the quick# upper bounds first -- have seen this speed up messy# compares by a factor of 3.# note that ratio() is only expensive to compute the first# time it's called on a sequence pair; the expensive part# of the computation is cached by cruncher# no non-identical "pretty close" pair# no identical pair either -- treat it as a straight replace# no close pair, but an identical pair -- synch up on that# there's a close pair, so forget the identical pair (if any)# a[best_i] very similar to b[best_j]; eqi is None iff they're not# identical# pump out diffs from before the synch point# do intraline marking on the synch pair# pump out a '-', '?', '+', '?' quad for the synched lines# the synch pair is identical# pump out diffs from after the synch point# With respect to junk, an earlier version of ndiff simply refused to# *start* a match with a junk element.  The result was cases like this:#     before: private Thread currentThread;#     after:  private volatile Thread currentThread;# If you consider whitespace to be junk, the longest contiguous match# not starting with junk is "e Thread currentThread".  So ndiff reported# that "e volatil" was inserted between the 't' and the 'e' in "private".# While an accurate view, to people that's absurd.  The current version# looks for matching blocks that are entirely junk-free, then extends the# longest one of those as far as possible but only with matching junk.# So now "currentThread" is matched, then extended to suck up the# preceding blank; then "private" is matched, and extended to suck up the# following blank; then "Thread" is matched; and finally ndiff reports# that "volatile " was inserted before "Thread".  The only quibble# remaining is that perhaps it was really the case that " volatile"# was inserted after "private".

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^

    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.

    'b'
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.

        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writeline()
        method of a file-like object.

        Example:

        >>> print(''.join(Differ().compare('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(True),

        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._fancy_replace(['abcDefghiJkl\n'], 0, 1,
        ...                            ['abcdefGhijkl\n'], 0, 1)

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    'u'
    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    'b'all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)'u'all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)'b'
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    exc_msg
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

      - examples: the list of examples.

      - globs: The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should
        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

      - docstring: The string that the examples were extracted from,
        or `None` if the string is unavailable.

        Create a new DocTest containing the given examples.  The
        DocTest's globals are initialized with a copy of `globs`.

        Divide the given string into examples and intervening text,
        and return them as a list of alternating Examples and strings.
        Line numbers for the Examples are 0-based.  The optional
        argument `name` is a name identifying this string, and is only
        used for error messages.
        _min_indentmin_indentcharno_parse_exampleget_doctest
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and

        `globs`, `name`, `filename`, and `lineno` are attributes for
        the new `DocTest` object.  See the documentation for `DocTest`
        for more information.
        get_examples
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return
        them as a list of `Example` objects.  Line numbers are
        0-based, because it's most common in doctests that nothing
        interesting appears on the same line as opening triple-quote,
        and so the first interesting line is called "line 1" then.

        The optional argument `name` is a name identifying this
        string, and is only used for error messages.
        
        Given a regular expression match from `_EXAMPLE_RE` (`m`),
        return a pair `(source, want)`, where `source` is the matched
        example's source code (with prompts and indentation stripped);
        and `want` is the example's expected output (with indentation
        stripped).

        `name` is the string's name, and `lineno` is the line number
        where the example starts; both are used for error messages.

        line %r of the docstring for %s has inconsistent leading whitespace: %r'line %r of the docstring for %s has ''inconsistent leading whitespace: %r'
    A class used to extract the DocTests that are relevant to a given
    object, from its docstring and the docstrings of its contained
    objects.  Doctests can currently be extracted from the following
    object types: modules, functions, classes, methods, staticmethods,
    classmethods, and properties.
    recurseexclude_empty
        Create a new doctest finder.

        The optional argument `parser` specifies a class or
        function that should be used to create new DocTest objects (or
        objects that implement the same interface as DocTest).  The
        signature for this factory function should match the signature
        of the DocTest constructor.

        If the optional argument `recurse` is false, then `find` will
        only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

        If the optional argument `exclude_empty` is false, then `find`
        will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.
        _verbose_recurse_exclude_emptyextraglobs
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}
        otherwise.  If `extraglobs` is not specified, then it defaults
        to {}.

        otherwise, return None.
        _find_lineno
        Return a line number of the given object's docstring.  Note:
        this method assumes that the object has a docstring.
        ^\s*class\s*%s\bistracebackisframeiscode(^|.*:)\s*\w*("|\')
    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:
        ...     print(test.name, '->', runner.run(test))
        _TestClass -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.__init__ -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass
           2 tests in _TestClass.__init__
           2 tests in _TestClass.get
           1 tests in _TestClass.square
        7 tests in 4 items.
        7 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.
        TestResults(failed=0, attempted=7)

    The aggregated number of tried examples and failed examples is
    also available via the `tries` and `failures` attributes:

        >>> runner.tries
        7
        >>> runner.failures
        0

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.
    DIVIDERchecker
        Create a new test runner.

        Optional keyword arg `checker` is the `OutputChecker` that
        should be used to compare the expected outputs and actual
        outputs of doctest examples.

        Optional keyword arg 'verbose' prints lots of stuff if true,
        only failures if false; by default, it's true iff '-v' is in
        sys.argv.

        Optional argument `optionflags` can be used to control how the
        test runner compares expected output to actual output, and how
        it displays failures.  See the documentation for `testmod` for
        more information.

        the test completes, then use `clear_globs=False`.

        `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by
        the Python compiler when running the examples.  If not
        specified, then it will default to the set of future-import
        flags that apply to `globs`.

        The output of each example is checked using
        `DocTestRunner.check_output`, and the results are formatted by
        the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods.
        save_tracesave_set_tracesave_displayhooksummarize
        Print a summary of all the test cases that have been run by
        this DocTestRunner, and return a tuple `(f, t)`, where `f` is
        the total number of failed examples, and `t` is the total
        number of tried examples.

        The optional `verbose` argument controls how detailed the
        summary is.  If the verbosity is not specified, then the
        DocTestRunner's verbosity is used.

    A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest
    example matches the expected output.  `OutputChecker` defines two
    methods: `check_output`, which compares a given pair of outputs,
    and returns true if they match; and `output_difference`, which
    returns a string describing the differences between two outputs.

        always considered to match if they are identical; but
        depending on what option flags the test runner is using,
        several non-exact match types are also possible.  See the
        documentation for `TestRunner` for more information about
        option flags.

A DocTest example has failed in debugging mode.

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - got: the actual output
    A DocTest example has encountered an unexpected exception

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - exc_info: the exception info
    Run doc tests but raise an exception as soon as there is a failure.

       If an unexpected exception occurs, an UnexpectedException is raised.
       It contains the test, the example, and the original exception:

         >>> runner = DebugRunner(verbose=False)
         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
         ...                                    {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
         >>> try:
         ...     runner.run(test)
         ... except UnexpectedException as f:
         ...     failure = f

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

         >>> failure.example.want
         '42\n'

         >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
         >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         KeyError

       We wrap the original exception to give the calling application
       access to the test and example information.

       If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 1
         ...      >>> x
         ...      2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> try:
         ...    runner.run(test)
         ... except DocTestFailure as f:
         ...    failure = f

       DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

       As well as to the example:

         >>> failure.example.want
         '2\n'

       and the actual output:

         >>> failure.got
         '1\n'

       If a failure or error occurs, the globals are left intact:

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 1}

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      >>> raise KeyError
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         doctest.UnexpectedException: <DocTest foo from foo.py:0 (2 examples)>

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 2}

       But the globals are cleared if there is no error:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)

    Test examples in docstrings in functions and classes reachable
    from module m (or the current module if m is not supplied), starting
    with m.__doc__.

    Also test examples reachable from dict m.__test__ if it exists and is
    not None.  m.__test__ maps names to functions, classes and strings;
    function and class docstrings are tested even if the name is private;
    strings are tested directly, as if they were docstrings.

    Return (#failures, #tests).

    See help(doctest) for an overview.

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the module; by default
    use m.__name__.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use m.__dict__.  A copy of this
    dict is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.  This is new in 2.4.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  This is new in 2.3.  Possible values (see the
    docs for details):

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
    testmod: module required; %r
    Test examples in the given file.  Return (#failures, #tests).

    Optional keyword arg "module_relative" specifies how filenames
    should be interpreted:

      - If "module_relative" is True (the default), then "filename"
         specifies a module-relative path.  By default, this path is
         relative to the calling module's directory; but if the
         "package" argument is specified, then it is relative to that
         package.  To ensure os-independence, "filename" should use
         "/" characters to separate path segments, and should not
         be an absolute path (i.e., it may not begin with "/").

      - If "module_relative" is False, then "filename" specifies an
        os-specific path.  The path may be absolute or relative (to
        the current working directory).

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the test; by default
    use the file's basename.

    Optional keyword argument "package" is a Python package or the
    name of a Python package whose directory should be used as the
    base directory for a module relative filename.  If no package is
    specified, then the calling module's directory is used as the base
    directory for module relative filenames.  It is an error to
    specify "package" if "module_relative" is False.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use {}.  A copy of this dict
    is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  Possible values (see the docs for details):

        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Optional keyword arg "parser" specifies a DocTestParser (or
    subclass) that should be used to extract tests from the files.

    Optional keyword arg "encoding" specifies an encoding that should
    be used to convert the file to unicode.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.

    Test examples in the given object's docstring (`f`), using `globs`
    as globals.  Optional argument `name` is used in failure messages.
    If the optional argument `verbose` is true, then generate output
    even if there are no failures.

    `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by the
    Python compiler when running the examples.  If not specified, then
    it will default to the set of future-import flags that apply to
    `globs`.

    Optional keyword arg `optionflags` specifies options for the
    testing and output.  See the documentation for `testmod` for more
    information.
    _unittest_reportflagsSets the unittest option flags.

    The old flag is returned so that a runner could restore the old
    value if it wished to:

      >>> import doctest
      >>> old = doctest._unittest_reportflags
      >>> doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(REPORT_NDIFF |
      ...                          REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE) == old

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
             ...                {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)
             >>> try:
             ...     case.debug()
             ... except UnexpectedException as f:
             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
             >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1
             ...      >>> x
             ...      2
             ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)

             >>> try:
             ...    case.debug()
             ... except DocTestFailure as f:
             ...    failure = f

           DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

           As well as to the example:

             >>> failure.example.want
             '2\n'

           and the actual output:

             >>> failure.got
             '1\n'

    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
       A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.
    DocFileCaseFailed doctest test for %s
  File "%s", line 0

%sDocFileTestA unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

    parser
      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    encoding
      An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.
    Extract script from text with examples.

       Converts text with examples to a Python script.  Example input is
       converted to regular code.  Example output and all other words

                                    In 2.2, boolean expressions displayed
                                    0 or 1.  By default, we still accept
                                    them.  This can be disabled by passing
                                    DONT_ACCEPT_TRUE_FOR_1 to the new
                                    optionflags argument.

                Blank lines can be marked with <BLANKLINE>:
                    >>> print('foo\n\nbar\n')
                    foo
                    <BLANKLINE>
                    bar
                    <BLANKLINE>
            blank lines
                If the ellipsis flag is used, then '...' can be used to
                elide substrings in the desired output:
                    >>> print(list(range(1000))) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
                    [0, 1, 2, ..., 999]
            
                If the whitespace normalization flag is used, then
                differences in whitespace are ignored.
                    >>> print(list(range(30))) #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

Utility Functions# We have two cases to cover and we need to make sure we do# them in the right order# get_data() opens files as 'rb', so one must do the equivalent# conversion as universal newlines would do.# This regexp matches the start of non-blank lines:# Get a traceback message.# Override some StringIO methods.# If anything at all was written, make sure there's a trailing# newline.  There's no way for the expected output to indicate# that a trailing newline is missing.# Worst-case linear-time ellipsis matching.# Find "the real" strings.# Deal with exact matches possibly needed at one or both ends.# starts with exact match# ends with exact match# Exact end matches required more characters than we have, as in# _ellipsis_match('aa...aa', 'aaa')# For the rest, we only need to find the leftmost non-overlapping# match for each piece.  If there's no overall match that way alone,# there's no overall match period.# w may be '' at times, if there are consecutive ellipses, or# due to an ellipsis at the start or end of `want`.  That's OK.# Search for an empty string succeeds, and doesn't change startpos.# Support for IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL.# Get rid of everything except the exception name; in particular, drop# the possibly dotted module path (if any) and the exception message (if# any).  We assume that a colon is never part of a dotted name, or of an# exception name.# E.g., given#    "foo.bar.MyError: la di da"# return "MyError"# Or for "abc.def" or "abc.def:\n" return "def".# The exception name must appear on the first line.# retain up to the first colon (if any)# retain just the exception name# do not play signal games in the pdb# still use input() to get user input# Calling set_continue unconditionally would break unit test# coverage reporting, as Bdb.set_continue calls sys.settrace(None).# Redirect stdout to the given stream.# Call Pdb's trace dispatch method.# [XX] Normalize with respect to os.path.pardir?# Normalize the path. On Windows, replace "/" with "\".# Find the base directory for the path.# A normal module/package# An interactive session.# A module w/o __file__ (this includes builtins)# Combine the base directory and the test path.## 2. Example & DocTest## - An "example" is a <source, want> pair, where "source" is a##   fragment of source code, and "want" is the expected output for##   "source."  The Example class also includes information about##   where the example was extracted from.## - A "doctest" is a collection of examples, typically extracted from##   a string (such as an object's docstring).  The DocTest class also##   includes information about where the string was extracted from.# Normalize inputs.# Store properties.# This lets us sort tests by name:## 3. DocTestParser# This regular expression is used to find doctest examples in a# string.  It defines three groups: `source` is the source code# (including leading indentation and prompts); `indent` is the# indentation of the first (PS1) line of the source code; and# `want` is the expected output (including leading indentation).# A regular expression for handling `want` strings that contain# expected exceptions.  It divides `want` into three pieces:#    - the traceback header line (`hdr`)#    - the traceback stack (`stack`)#    - the exception message (`msg`), as generated by#      traceback.format_exception_only()# `msg` may have multiple lines.  We assume/require that the# exception message is the first non-indented line starting with a word# character following the traceback header line.# A callable returning a true value iff its argument is a blank line# or contains a single comment.# If all lines begin with the same indentation, then strip it.# Find all doctest examples in the string:# Add the pre-example text to    rW    
